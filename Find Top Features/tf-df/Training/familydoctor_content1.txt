It prevents pregnancy either by damaging or killing a man\xe2\x80\x99s sperm, or blocking it from entering a woman\xe2\x80\x99s uterus. An IUD is a small, T-shaped device with a string attached to the end. The purpose of the string is to make sure the IUD stays in place. It also is how a doctor removes the device.\nThere are 2 types of IUDs available in the United States. ParaGard is the non-hormonal option. It has copper rings, or coils, that alter the chemicals in your uterine fluid to kill sperm. You should not use ParaGard if you are allergic to copper. Hormonal options include Mirena, Liletta, and Skyla. These release progestin hormones to thicken your cervical mucus and stop ovulation.\nPath to improved health\nYour primary care or women\xe2\x80\x99s doctor can insert an IUD. They can insert ParaGard at any time during your menstrual cycle. Hormonal IUDs should be inserted in the first 7 days of your cycle. The procedure is quick and done in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office. The doctor puts a small plastic tube with the IUD into your vagina. You may have pain or cramping during this process. Discomfort can last several hours or days. Most doctors suggest that you have someone else drive you home from the appointment.\nIUDs start working immediately. You can have sex, exercise, and use tampons. An IUD is effective for 3 to 10 years, depending on the type. Your doctor can remove it at any time.\nCall your doctor right away if you have the following symptoms or problems. They will check your IUD, and may remove or replace it.\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t find the string.\nYou can feel the IUD.\nYour IUD comes loose or falls out.\nYou have a fever or chills.\nYou have abnormal blood, fluid, or odor coming from your vagina.\nThings to consider\nYou should not use an IUD if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding. Cancer of the cervix or uterus or AIDS infection prevent IUD use, as well. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use an IUD if you are pregnant or want to become pregnant. You can, however, get an IUD after giving birth. The best time for the doctor to insert it is after delivery of the baby and placenta.\nIUDs do not protect you from sexually transmitted diseases or infections (STDs or STIs). To reduce your risk of getting an STD, use a condom when you have sex. IUDs can affect your menstrual cycle. At first, you may have pain, cramping, or spotting (light bleeding) between periods. This can last for 3 to 6 months. Hormonal IUDs can cause your periods to be irregular. They may also cause you to miss periods. Copper IUDs can cause worse cramps and bleeding during your period.\nThe benefits of IUDs include:\nprevention success rate of 99% when used properly\nuse of 3 to 10 years, depending on the type\ncan be removed by your doctor at any time\nconvenience\nsafe for women who just gave birth and/or are breastfeeding\ncannot be felt during sex\nlow risk of side effects.\nRisks are uncommon, but include:\ninjury to the uterus when the IUD is being inserted\nincreased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease if you have an STD\nchance of getting pregnant, in which case your doctor should remove the IUD. If you become pregnant, the risk of miscarriage and health problems for you and the baby increase.\nchance of an ectopic pregnancy. This occurs when an egg fertilizes outside of your uterus. It is rare, but can be harmful for a woman.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nHow do I know which IUD is right for me, or if I should use another form of birth control?\nAre there any other health conditions that prevent me from using an IUD?\nDoes my age play a factor in which type and brand of IUD I get?\nDoes my insurance cover an IUD?\nHow often do I need to check my IUD, either by a doctor or myself?\nWhat happens after an IUD expires?\nResources\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians, Birth Control Options\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians, Intrauterine Devices\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Intrauterine Devices (IUD)\nLast Updated: May 8, 2017\nThis article was contributed by familydoctor.org editorial staff.\nCategories: Birth Control, Family Health, Prevention and Wellness, Sex and Birth Control, WomenTags: female, gynecologic, Insertion/removal of intrauterine device (IUD) September 1, 2000\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.
