I had been missing a day or more of school every month because of my period. After I started taking The Pill, my cramps almost disappeared and my period became more regular. Once I got to college, I switched to a hormonal IUD (intrauterine device, a small birth control device, often shaped like a "T" that goes in the uterus). That IUD helped me finish college and grad school without cramps or any unplanned pregnancies. Thanks, birth control!\nMore than 88% of women of reproductive age in the United States have used birth control at some point in their lives. There are a lot of reasons to be thankful for birth control \xe2\x80\x94 and everyone\'s are different. But here are a few reasons we can all say "thanks."\nBirth control lets you decide when to get pregnant.\nStarting or growing a family is a big deal. Access to effective birth control lets you decide when (and with whom) you have children. Whether you\'re waiting for the perfect partner to have kids with, already have the number of kids you want, want more kids but not right now, or don\'t want kids at all, birth control puts you in the driver\'s seat of your reproductive health.\nBirth control can help you achieve your goals.\nBeing in control of when or whether you get pregnant means having more freedom to pursue educational, professional, and personal goals. Research has linked better access to birth control with major educational and professional achievements for women. A recent study (link is external) asked more than 2,000 women how using birth control to prevent pregnancy had affected their lives. Sixty-four percent said birth control definitely or somewhat helped them finish school, 64% said it definitely or somewhat helped them get or keep a job or pursue their career, and 71% said birth control definitely or somewhat helped them support themselves financially.\nBirth control has health benefits.\nLots of women use birth control for reasons other than pregnancy prevention. Besides helping regulate your period, birth control can have some great health benefits. Depending on your method, birth control can:\nDecrease the risk for ovarian and endometrial cancer\nHelp with painful or heavy periods (link is external)\nProtect against sexually transmitted infections (thanks, condoms!) (link is external)\nReduce acne\nBeing able to decide when you get pregnant also has major health benefits. Mothers are healthier (link is external) (PDF, 687 KB) when they can control when they become pregnant, and healthier mothers are better for babies.\nThere are more birth control methods than you think.\nMany people know about only a few birth control options, like condoms and the pill. In fact, there are over a dozen different methods of birth control (link is external) and even more options within each type of method. There are methods that are safe for new moms (link is external), methods that work for folks with health conditions (link is external), methods with different kinds of hormones (link is external), methods with no hormones (link is external), and the list goes on. And because of the Affordable Care Act most health insurance plans are required to cover the full range of\nFDA\xe2\x80\x93approved birth control methods (PDF, 914 KB) without out-of-pocket costs!\nReady to say, "Thanks"?\nOn November 10th, we\'re celebrating in a big way. Join us to say "Thanks, Birth Control" by sharing an\xc2\xa0e-card (link is external)\xc2\xa0and using the hashtag #ThxBirthControl to be part of the conversation!\nJill Eversole is a digital media intern at The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. She works on creating online content for\xc2\xa0Bedsider.org (link is external), a website to help young adults use birth control consistently and effectively. Jill has a master\'s degree in public health from the University of California, Berkeley, where she focused on sex education and pregnancy prevention.\nRead full blog post\nHealthcare and Women | Reproductive and Sexual Health\nPrevious Page\nNext Page\n134 of 284\nSubscribe\nTo receive Blog email updates\nSubmit\nAbout Us\nWho we are\nWhat we do\nWork with us\nOur vision and mission\nPrograms and Activities\nHealth Information Gateway\nIt\'s Only Natural\nMake the Call, Don\'t Miss a Beat\nNational Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day\nNational Women\'s Health Week\nSupporting Nursing Moms at Work\nPopular Topics\nAutoimmune diseases\nBreastfeeding\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\nDepression\nHIV and AIDS\nMenstruation\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nPregnancy\nThyroid disease\nAll A-Z health topics\nFind Help\nGet breastfeeding help\nGet health care\nGet health insurance\nGet help with family planning\nGet help with mental health\nGet vaccines\nFind girls\' health information\nStay Connected\nBlog\nContact us\nMedia inquiries\nSocial media\nAbout Us\nWho we are\nWhat we do\nWork with us\nOur vision and mission\nPrograms and Activities\nHealth Information Gateway\nIt\'s Only Natural\nMake the Call, Don\'t Miss a Beat\nNational Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day\nNational Women\'s Health Week\nSupporting Nursing Moms at Work\nPopular Topics\nAutoimmune diseases\nBreastfeeding\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\nDepression\nHIV and AIDS\nMenstruation\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nPregnancy\nThyroid disease\nAll A-Z health topics\nFind Help\nGet breastfeeding help\nGet health care\nGet health insurance\nGet help with family planning\nGet help with mental health\nGet vaccines\nFind girls\' health information\nStay Connected\nBlog\nContact us\nMedia inquiries\nSocial media\nSubscribe to receive OWH updates\nSubmit\nHHS Non-Discrimination Notice\nLanguage Assistance Available\nAccessibility\nPrivacy Policy\nDisclaimers\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA)\nUSA.gov\nUse Our Content\nLanguage Assistance Available\nEspa\xc3\xb1ol\n\xe7\xb9\x81\xe9\xab\x94\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87\nTi\xe1\xba\xbfng Vi\xe1\xbb\x87t\n\xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4\nTagalog\n\xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9\n\xd8\xa7\xd9\x84\xd8\xb9\xd8\xb1\xd8\xa8\xd9\x8a\xd8\xa9\nKrey\xc3\xb2l Ayisyen\nFran\xc3\xa7ais\nPolski\nPortugu\xc3\xaas\nItaliano\nDeutsch\n\xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e\n\xd9\x81\xd8\xa7\xd8\xb1\xd8\xb3\xdb\x8c\nEnglish\nA federal government website managed by the Office on Women\'s Health in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human\xc2\xa0Services.\n200 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC\xc2\xa020201\n1-800-994-9662 \xe2\x80\xa2 Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET (closed on federal\xc2\xa0holidays).\nTop'
