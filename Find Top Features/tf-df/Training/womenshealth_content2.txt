Women can choose from many different types of birth control. Some work better than others at preventing pregnancy.\xc2\xa0The type of birth control you use depends on your health, your desire to have children now or in the future, and your need to prevent sexually transmitted infections. Your doctor can help you decide which type is best for you right now.\nExpand all\n|\nCollapse all\nWhat is the best method of birth control?\nThere is no "best" method of birth control for every woman. The birth control method that is right for you and your partner depends on many things, and may change over time.\nBefore choosing a birth control method, talk to your doctor or nurse about:\nWhether you want to get pregnant soon, in a few years, or never\nHow well each method works to prevent pregnancy\nPossible side effects\nHow often you have sex\nThe number of sex partners you have\nYour overall health\nHow comfortable you are with using the method (For example, can you remember to take a pill every day? Will you have to ask your partner to put on a condom each time?)\nLearn about types of birth control\xc2\xa0that you or your partner can use to prevent pregnancy.\nKeep in mind that even the most effective birth control methods can fail. But your chances of getting pregnant are lower if you use a more effective method.\nWhat are the different types of birth control?\nWomen can choose from many different types of birth control methods. These include, in order of most effective to least effective at preventing pregnancy:\nFemale and male sterilization (female tubal ligation or occlusion, male vasectomy) \xe2\x80\x94 Birth control that prevents pregnancy for the rest of your life through surgery or a medical procedure.\nLong-acting reversible contraceptives or "LARC" methods (intrauterine devices, hormonal implants) \xe2\x80\x94 Birth control your doctor inserts one time and you do not have to remember to use birth control every day or month. LARCs last for 3 to 10 years, depending on the method.\nShort-acting hormonal methods (pill, mini pills, patch, shot, vaginal ring) \xe2\x80\x94 Birth control your doctor prescribes that you remember to take every day or month. The shot requires you to get a shot from your doctor every 3 months.\nBarrier methods (condoms, diaphragms, sponge, cervical cap) \xe2\x80\x94 Birth control you use each time you have sex.\nNatural rhythm methods \xe2\x80\x94 Not using a type of birth control but instead avoiding sex and/or using birth control only on the days when you are most fertile (most likely to get pregnant).

If you have sex, the best way to prevent both STIs and pregnancy is to use what is called "dual protection." Dual protection means you use a condom to prevent STIs each time you have sex, and at the same time, you use a more effective form of birth control, such as an IUD, implant, or shot.\nWhich types of birth control can I get without a prescription?\nYou can buy these types of birth control over the counter at a drugstore or supermarket:\nMale condoms\nFemale condoms\nSponges\nSpermicides\nEmergency contraception (EC) pills. Plan B One-Step\xc2\xae and its generic versions are available in drugstores and some supermarkets to anyone, without a prescription. However you should not use EC as your regular birth control because it does not work as well as regular birth control. EC is meant to be used only when your regular birth control does not work for some unexpected reason.\nWhich types of birth control do I have to see my doctor to get?\nYou need a prescription for these types of birth control:\nOral contraceptives: the pill and the mini-pill (in some states, birth control pills are now available without a prescription, through the pharmacy)\nPatch\nVaginal ring\nDiaphragms (your doctor or nurse needs to fit one to the shape of your vagina)\nShot/injection (you get the shot at your doctor\'s office or family planning clinic)\nCervical cap\nImplantable rod (inserted by a doctor in the office or clinic)\nIUD (inserted by a doctor in the office or clinic)\nYou will need surgery or a medical procedure for:\nFemale sterilization (tubal ligation)\nMale sterilization (vasectomy)\nTubal implant (Essure\xc2\xae)\nPlease note that Essure\xc2\xae will not be sold or distributed in the United States after December 31, 2018.\nHow does birth control work?\nBirth control works to prevent pregnancy in different ways, depending upon the type of birth control you choose:\nFemale or male sterilization surgery prevents the sperm from reaching the egg by cutting or damaging the tubes that carry sperm (in men) or eggs (in women).\nLong-acting reversible contraceptives or "LARC" methods (intrauterine devices, hormonal implants) prevent your ovaries from releasing eggs, prevent sperm from getting to the egg, or make implantation of the egg in the uterus (womb) unlikely.\nShort-acting hormonal methods, such as the pill, mini-pill, patch, shot, and vaginal ring, prevent your ovaries from releasing eggs or prevent sperm from getting to the egg.\nBarrier methods, such as condoms, diaphragms, sponge, cervical cap, prevent sperm from getting to the egg.\nNatural rhythm methods involve avoiding sex or using other forms of birth control on the days when you are most fertile (most likely to get pregnant).\nAre birth control pills safe?\nYes, hormonal birth control methods, such as the pill, are safe for most women. Today\'s birth control pills have lower doses of hormones than in the past. This has lowered the risk of side effects and serious health problems.\nToday\'s birth control pills can have health benefits\xc2\xa0for some women, such as a lower risk of some kinds of cancer.5 Also, different brands and types of birth control pills (and other forms of hormonal birth control) can increase your risk for some health problems and side effects. Side effects can include weight gain, headaches, irregular bleeding, breast tenderness, and mood changes.\nTalk to your doctor about whether hormonal birth control is right for you.\nDoes birth control raise my risk for health problems?\nIt can, depending on your health and the type of birth control you use. Talk to your doctor to find the birth control method that is right for you.\nDifferent forms of birth control have different health risks and side effects. Some birth control methods that increase your risk for health problems include:\nHormonal birth control. Combination birth control pills (birth control with both estrogen and progesterone) and some other forms of hormonal birth control, such as the vaginal ring or skin patch, may raise your risk for blood clots and high blood pressure. Blood clots and high blood pressure can cause a heart attack or stroke. A blood clot in the legs can also go to your lungs, causing serious damage or even death. These are serious side effects of hormonal birth control, but they are rare.\nSpermicides (used alone or with the cervical cap, diaphragm or sponge). Spermicides that have nonoxynol-9 can irritate the vagina. This can raise your risk for getting HIV. Use spermicides with nonoxynol-9 only if you are in a monogamous relationship (you have sex only with each other) with a man you know is HIV-negative. Also, medicines for vaginal yeast infections may make spermicides less effective.\nIntrauterine devices (IUDs). IUDs can slightly raise your risk of an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies happen when a fertilized egg implants somewhere outside of the uterus (womb), usually in one of the fallopian tubes. An ectopic pregnancy is a serious medical problem that should be treated as soon as possible. IUDs also have a very rare but serious risk of infection or puncture of the uterus.\nWhat are the health risks for smokers who use birth control?\nIf you smoke and are 35 or older, you should not use hormonal birth control. Smoking tobacco and using hormonal birth control raises your risk for blood clots and high blood pressure. Smoking and high blood pressure are risk factors for a heart attack or stroke. The risk for a heart attack or stroke also goes up as you age.\nCan birth control help with my painful or heavy periods?\nMaybe. Research shows that hormonal birth control, such as the pill, patch, shot, ring, implantable rod, and hormonal IUD, may help with heavy, painful, or long-term bleeding. These methods can also help you have lighter, shorter periods.6\nWhat are some other benefits of hormonal birth control?\nResearch shows that other benefits of hormonal birth control may include:6,7\nMore regular and lighter periods\nFewer menstrual cramps\nLess acne\nA lower risk of ovary, endometrial (uterus), and colon cancers, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), noncancerous ovarian cysts, and iron-deficiency anemia\nRead more about how birth control can help with the following health problems:\nOvarian cysts\nEndometriosis\nPolycystic ovary syndrome\nUterine fibroids\nWhat do I do if I miss a day taking the pill?\nFollow the instructions that came with your birth control about using back-up birth control (such as a condom and spermicide). You also can follow these recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.1\nIf you are late or miss a day taking your pill:\nTake the late or missed pill as soon as possible.\nContinue taking the rest of your pills at your normal time, even if it means taking two pills on the same day.\nYou do not need other forms of birth control, such as a condom, unless you need to protect against STIs.\nIf you miss two or more days in a row:\nTake only the most recent missed pill as soon as possible.\nContinue taking the rest of your pills at your normal time, even if it means taking two pills on the same day.\nUse back-up birth control, such as a condom and spermicide, or do not have sex until you have taken a pill for seven days in a row.\nIf you missed pills during days in the last week of active pills (days 15\xe2\x80\x9321 for 28-day pill packs), start a new pack the next day. If you are not able to start a new pack right away, use back-up birth control or avoid sex until hormone pills from a new pack have been taken for 7 days in a row.\nConsider emergency contraception if you missed pills during the first week and had sex.\nTalk to your doctor if you continue to miss taking your birth control pill or find it hard to take the pill at the same time each day. You may want to consider a different type of birth control, such as an IUD, an implant, shot, ring, or patch that you don\'t have to remember to take every day.\nHow effective is the withdrawal method?\nNot very! About 22 out of 100 women who use withdrawal as their only form of birth control for a year will get pregnant. See the chart above\xc2\xa0for how this number compares to other methods of birth control.\nWithdrawal is when a man takes his penis out of a woman\'s vagina ("pulls out") before he ejaculates or "comes" (has an orgasm). This lowers the chance of sperm from going to the egg. "Pulling out" can be hard for a man to do. It takes a lot of self-control.\nEven if you use withdrawal, sperm can be released before the man pulls out. When a man\'s penis first becomes erect, some fluid may be on the tip of the penis. This fluid has sperm in it, so you could still get pregnant. Withdrawal also does not protect you from STIs, including HIV.\nDoes breastfeeding prevent pregnancy?\nBreastfeeding can be a short-term method of birth control in very specific situations. The risk of pregnancy is less than 2 in 100 if all three of these describe you:1\nYou have a baby who is less than 6 months old\nand\nYou exclusively breastfeed, meaning that you only feed your baby your breastmilk all of the time (no formula, no breastmilk from other people, and no solid food)\nand\nYou have not gotten a period after childbirth\nTalk to your doctor about birth control if you do not want to get pregnant while nursing.\nHow can I get free or low-cost birth control?\nUnder the Affordable Care Act (the health care law), most insurance plans cover FDA-approved prescription birth control for women, such as the pill, IUDs, and female sterilization, at no additional cost to you. This also includes birth control counseling.\nIf you have insurance, check with your insurance provider to find out what is included in your plan.\nIf you have Medicaid, your insurance covers birth control. This includes birth control prescriptions and visits to your doctor related to birth control. Programs vary between states, so check with your state\'s Medicaid program to learn what your benefits are.\nIf you don\'t have insurance, don\'t panic. Family planning (reproductive health) clinics may provide some birth control methods for free or at low cost. Call your local clinic or enter your ZIP code in this clinic finder tool to learn more.\nFor information about other services covered by the Affordable Care Act, visit HealthCare.gov.\nDid we answer your question about birth control methods?\nFor more information about birth control methods, call the OWH Helpline at 1-800-994-9662 or contact the following organizations:\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA), HHS\nPhone Number: 888-463-6332\nOffice of Population Affairs, HHS\nPhone Number: 240-453-2888\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (link is external)\nPhone Number: 800-762-2264 x 349 (for publications requests only)\nPlanned Parenthood (link is external)\nPhone Number: 800-230-7526\nSources\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

If you have sex, the best way to prevent both STIs and pregnancy is to use what is called "dual protection." Dual protection means you use a condom to prevent STIs each time you have sex, and at the same time, you use a more effective form of birth control, such as an IUD, implant, or shot.\nWhich types of birth control can I get without a prescription?\nYou can buy these types of birth control over the counter at a drugstore or supermarket:\nMale condoms\nFemale condoms\nSponges\nSpermicides\nEmergency contraception (EC) pills. Plan B One-Step\xc2\xae and its generic versions are available in drugstores and some supermarkets to anyone, without a prescription. However you should not use EC as your regular birth control because it does not work as well as regular birth control. EC is meant to be used only when your regular birth control does not work for some unexpected reason.\nWhich types of birth control do I have to see my doctor to get?\nYou need a prescription for these types of birth control:\nOral contraceptives: the pill and the mini-pill (in some states, birth control pills are now available without a prescription, through the pharmacy)\nPatch\nVaginal ring\nDiaphragms (your doctor or nurse needs to fit one to the shape of your vagina)\nShot/injection (you get the shot at your doctor\'s office or family planning clinic)\nCervical cap\nImplantable rod (inserted by a doctor in the office or clinic)\nIUD (inserted by a doctor in the office or clinic)\nYou will need surgery or a medical procedure for:\nFemale sterilization (tubal ligation)\nMale sterilization (vasectomy)\nTubal implant (Essure\xc2\xae)\nPlease note that Essure\xc2\xae will not be sold or distributed in the United States after December 31, 2018.\nHow does birth control work?\nBirth control works to prevent pregnancy in different ways, depending upon the type of birth control you choose:\nFemale or male sterilization surgery prevents the sperm from reaching the egg by cutting or damaging the tubes that carry sperm (in men) or eggs (in women).\nLong-acting reversible contraceptives or "LARC" methods (intrauterine devices, hormonal implants) prevent your ovaries from releasing eggs, prevent sperm from getting to the egg, or make implantation of the egg in the uterus (womb) unlikely.\nShort-acting hormonal methods, such as the pill, mini-pill, patch, shot, and vaginal ring, prevent your ovaries from releasing eggs or prevent sperm from getting to the egg.\nBarrier methods, such as condoms, diaphragms, sponge, cervical cap, prevent sperm from getting to the egg.\nNatural rhythm methods involve avoiding sex or using other forms of birth control on the days when you are most fertile (most likely to get pregnant).\nAre birth control pills safe?\nYes, hormonal birth control methods, such as the pill, are safe for most women. Today\'s birth control pills have lower doses of hormones than in the past. This has lowered the risk of side effects and serious health problems.\nToday\'s birth control pills can have health benefits\xc2\xa0for some women, such as a lower risk of some kinds of cancer.5 Also, different brands and types of birth control pills (and other forms of hormonal birth control) can increase your risk for some health problems and side effects. Side effects can include weight gain, headaches, irregular bleeding, breast tenderness, and mood changes.\nTalk to your doctor about whether hormonal birth control is right for you.\nDoes birth control raise my risk for health problems?\nIt can, depending on your health and the type of birth control you use. Talk to your doctor to find the birth control method that is right for you.\nDifferent forms of birth control have different health risks and side effects. Some birth control methods that increase your risk for health problems include:\nHormonal birth control. Combination birth control pills (birth control with both estrogen and progesterone) and some other forms of hormonal birth control, such as the vaginal ring or skin patch, may raise your risk for blood clots and high blood pressure. Blood clots and high blood pressure can cause a heart attack or stroke. A blood clot in the legs can also go to your lungs, causing serious damage or even death. These are serious side effects of hormonal birth control, but they are rare.\nSpermicides (used alone or with the cervical cap, diaphragm or sponge). Spermicides that have nonoxynol-9 can irritate the vagina. This can raise your risk for getting HIV. Use spermicides with nonoxynol-9 only if you are in a monogamous relationship (you have sex only with each other) with a man you know is HIV-negative. Also, medicines for vaginal yeast infections may make spermicides less effective.\nIntrauterine devices (IUDs). IUDs can slightly raise your risk of an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies happen when a fertilized egg implants somewhere outside of the uterus (womb), usually in one of the fallopian tubes. An ectopic pregnancy is a serious medical problem that should be treated as soon as possible. IUDs also have a very rare but serious risk of infection or puncture of the uterus.\nWhat are the health risks for smokers who use birth control?\nIf you smoke and are 35 or older, you should not use hormonal birth control. Smoking tobacco and using hormonal birth control raises your risk for blood clots and high blood pressure. Smoking and high blood pressure are risk factors for a heart attack or stroke. The risk for a heart attack or stroke also goes up as you age.\nCan birth control help with my painful or heavy periods?\nMaybe. Research shows that hormonal birth control, such as the pill, patch, shot, ring, implantable rod, and hormonal IUD, may help with heavy, painful, or long-term bleeding. These methods can also help you have lighter, shorter periods.6\nWhat are some other benefits of hormonal birth control?\nResearch shows that other benefits of hormonal birth control may include:6,7\nMore regular and lighter periods\nFewer menstrual cramps\nLess acne\nA lower risk of ovary, endometrial (uterus), and colon cancers, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), noncancerous ovarian cysts, and iron-deficiency anemia\nRead more about how birth control can help with the following health problems:\nOvarian cysts\nEndometriosis\nPolycystic ovary syndrome\nUterine fibroids\nWhat do I do if I miss a day taking the pill?\nFollow the instructions that came with your birth control about using back-up birth control (such as a condom and spermicide). You also can follow these recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.1\nIf you are late or miss a day taking your pill:\nTake the late or missed pill as soon as possible.\nContinue taking the rest of your pills at your normal time, even if it means taking two pills on the same day.\nYou do not need other forms of birth control, such as a condom, unless you need to protect against STIs.\nIf you miss two or more days in a row:\nTake only the most recent missed pill as soon as possible.\nContinue taking the rest of your pills at your normal time, even if it means taking two pills on the same day.\nUse back-up birth control, such as a condom and spermicide, or do not have sex until you have taken a pill for seven days in a row.\nIf you missed pills during days in the last week of active pills (days 15\xe2\x80\x9321 for 28-day pill packs), start a new pack the next day. If you are not able to start a new pack right away, use back-up birth control or avoid sex until hormone pills from a new pack have been taken for 7 days in a row.\nConsider emergency contraception if you missed pills during the first week and had sex.\nTalk to your doctor if you continue to miss taking your birth control pill or find it hard to take the pill at the same time each day. You may want to consider a different type of birth control, such as an IUD, an implant, shot, ring, or patch that you don\'t have to remember to take every day.\nHow effective is the withdrawal method?\nNot very! About 22 out of 100 women who use withdrawal as their only form of birth control for a year will get pregnant. See the chart above\xc2\xa0for how this number compares to other methods of birth control.\nWithdrawal is when a man takes his penis out of a woman\'s vagina ("pulls out") before he ejaculates or "comes" (has an orgasm). This lowers the chance of sperm from going to the egg. "Pulling out" can be hard for a man to do. It takes a lot of self-control.\nEven if you use withdrawal, sperm can be released before the man pulls out. When a man\'s penis first becomes erect, some fluid may be on the tip of the penis. This fluid has sperm in it, so you could still get pregnant. Withdrawal also does not protect you from STIs, including HIV.\nDoes breastfeeding prevent pregnancy?\nBreastfeeding can be a short-term method of birth control in very specific situations. The risk of pregnancy is less than 2 in 100 if all three of these describe you:1\nYou have a baby who is less than 6 months old\nand\nYou exclusively breastfeed, meaning that you only feed your baby your breastmilk all of the time (no formula, no breastmilk from other people, and no solid food)\nand\nYou have not gotten a period after childbirth\nTalk to your doctor about birth control if you do not want to get pregnant while nursing.\nHow can I get free or low-cost birth control?\nUnder the Affordable Care Act (the health care law), most insurance plans cover FDA-approved prescription birth control for women, such as the pill, IUDs, and female sterilization, at no additional cost to you. This also includes birth control counseling.\nIf you have insurance, check with your insurance provider to find out what is included in your plan.\nIf you have Medicaid, your insurance covers birth control. This includes birth control prescriptions and visits to your doctor related to birth control. Programs vary between states, so check with your state\'s Medicaid program to learn what your benefits are.\nIf you don\'t have insurance, don\'t panic. Family planning (reproductive health) clinics may provide some birth control methods for free or at low cost. Call your local clinic or enter your ZIP code in this clinic finder tool to learn more.\nFor information about other services covered by the Affordable Care Act, visit HealthCare.gov.\nDid we answer your question about birth control methods?\nFor more information about birth control methods, call the OWH Helpline at 1-800-994-9662 or contact the following organizations:\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA), HHS\nPhone Number: 888-463-6332\nOffice of Population Affairs, HHS\nPhone Number: 240-453-2888\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (link is external)\nPhone Number: 800-762-2264 x 349 (for publications requests only)\nPlanned Parenthood (link is external)\nPhone Number: 800-230-7526\nSources\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.
