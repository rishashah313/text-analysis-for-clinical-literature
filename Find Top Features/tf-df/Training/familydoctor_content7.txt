It is commonly referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cgetting your tubes tied.\xe2\x80\x9d It is a surgery that keeps a woman from getting pregnant. It closes off her fallopian tubes. These tubes carry an egg from the ovary to the uterus each month. Sperm swim up the fallopian tubes to join with the egg, resulting in pregnancy. When the tubes are closed, the egg and sperm cannot reach each other. This prevents pregnancy.\nTubal sterilization is a permanent form of birth control. It is one of the most effective options for preventing pregnancy. But it is difficult to reverse. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t need your partner\xe2\x80\x99s consent to have a tubal sterilization. But talking about the procedure beforehand is best for most relationships.\nPath to improved well being\nTubal sterilization is performed in a hospital or an outpatient surgery center. The procedure can be done on an outpatient basis at any time. Postpartum sterilization can take place right after a woman gives birth, if it was a cesarean delivery (C-section). It can also be performed within hours or days of a vaginal delivery.\nYou will receive anesthesia before the procedure is done. You won\xe2\x80\x99t feel anything. During the procedure, your doctor will likely make 1 or 2 incisions (cuts) in your abdomen. He or she will insert special instruments into the incisions. Using the instruments, they will seal off the fallopian tubes by blocking them with plastic clips, clamps, or rings. Or they may remove or destroy a small piece of each tube.\nAfter the procedure, your doctor will stitch up your incisions. You should be able to go home in a few hours. If the procedure follows childbirth, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to spend any extra time in the hospital.\nAfter the procedure\nYou may have some symptoms after the procedure, including:\nabdominal pain, cramping\nfatigue\ndizziness\ndiscomfort at incision site(s)\nshoulder pain.\nAs with any surgical procedure, problems can sometimes occur. Contact your doctor right away if you:\ndevelop a fever\nbleed from an incision\nhave severe stomach pain that won\xe2\x80\x99t stop\nhave fainting spells.\nRecovery after tubal sterilization is usually complete in a couple of days. You may want to take it easy for a week or so. Avoid heavy lifting for 1 week.\nYou will still have a period after your tubes are tied. Some temporary forms of birth control, such as the pill, help irregular menstrual cycles. Sterilization doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. If you had irregular periods before using any type of birth control, you will likely have irregular periods again after sterilization.\nAsk your doctor how long you should wait after the procedure before having sex. Don\xe2\x80\x99t have sex until you feel comfortable. You usually need to wait about a week after surgery. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wait at least 4 weeks if sterilization is done shortly after childbirth.\nThings to consider\nTubal sterilization is a permanent form of birth control. If you think you might want to reverse the procedure someday, you should not have it done. Reversal is possible, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated, major surgery. It\xe2\x80\x99s not always successful. Even a successful reversal doesn\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee that you can get pregnant again. If you do get pregnant, you have an increased risk of complications, such as ectopic pregnancy. Plus, the surgery is expensive and is usually not covered by health insurance.\nRemember that sterilization won\xe2\x80\x99t protect you against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Always use a condom during sexual activity to prevent STIs.\nSome women worry that sterilization will change them, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. It won\xe2\x80\x99t make you less feminine. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cause weight gain or the growth of facial hair. It won\xe2\x80\x99t decrease your sexual pleasure or cause menopause to start.\nTalk to your doctor anytime you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about a new form of birth control, especially a permanent one. You have many choices. Make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s the best choice for you.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nIs permanent birth control the best choice for me?\nAre there other forms of permanent birth control?\nWhat if I want to reverse the procedure later on?\nWhen is the best time for me to have the procedure done?\nWhat are the risks involved with the procedure?\nCould I get pregnant after having a tubal sterilization?\nResources\nOffice on Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Birth Control Methods\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration, Birth Control: Medicines to Help You\nLast Updated: May 11, 2017\nThis article was contributed by familydoctor.org editorial staff.\nCategories: Birth Control, Prevention and Wellness, Sex and Birth ControlTags: female, gynecologic, tubal ligation June 1, 2004\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.
