Congress has played a key role in establishing and authorizing these offices on women\xe2\x80\x99s health in the federal government, in addition to funding the work of the government each year. The 2010 Affordable Care Act codifies the establishment of several Offices of Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health within HHS and gives these offices, all of which were already in existence, new authority, agency, and protection from termination or reorganization without the direct approval of Congress.\nRead More\nCancer and Steroid Hormone (CASH) studyFamily planning, and the modern era of birth control that was ushered in by the first approval of birth control pills in 1960, has been named one of the\xc2\xa0Ten Great Public Health Achievements in the 20th Century\xc2\xa0by the CDC. But, a number of studies suggested possible links between birth control pills and cancer or heart disease that required further research.\nRead More\nApproval of emergency contraceptionEmergency contraception can help prevent pregnancy in women who had sex without using birth control, whose birth control method failed, and who were sexually assaulted. Emergency contraceptives, which are much like birth control pills, prevent pregnancy by stopping release of the egg from the ovary and by blocking sperm\'s access to the egg.\xc2\xa0The copper IUD can also be used as a method of emergency contraception.\nRead More\nBuilding better osteoporosis treatmentsOsteoporosis is a disease that weakens bones, causing them to become fragile and break more easily. Osteoporosis can occur in both men and women and at any age, but it is most common in older women. Women lose bone mass at a faster rate after menopause, when the body stops making the hormone estrogen.\xc2\xa0Osteoporosis causes half of all women over age 50 to break a bone in their lifetime.\nRead More\nEfforts to improve pregnant women\'s health and outcomesToday, most women in the United States receive excellent health care during pregnancy. As a result, the U.S. infant mortality rate has dropped to an all-time low of 6 deaths per 1,000 births. However, pregnancy-related deaths and serious complications for mothers have increased in the United States during the last 30 years, for reasons that are uncertain. The increase could be due to a combination of circumstances, including improved data collection on pregnancy mortality, an increase in the number of older mothers, and the increase in obesity among women.\nRead More\n\xc2\xab first\n\xe2\x80\xb9 previous\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nnext \xe2\x80\xba\nlast \xc2\xbb\n30 Achievements in Women\'s Health in 30 Years (1984 \xe2\x80\x93 2014)\n>\xc2\xa0Learn more from former\xc2\xa0OWH director Nancy Lee\xc2\xa0about\xc2\xa0this list.\n30 Achievements in Women\'s Health in 30 Years (1984 \xe2\x80\x93 2014) (PDF, 446\xc2\xa0KB)\nSee more ways that NIH research has advanced women\'s health.\nRead more about the HHS\xc2\xa0offices and agencies\xc2\xa0included in this section.\nAll material contained on these pages are free of copyright restrictions and may be copied, reproduced, or duplicated without permission of the Office on Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
