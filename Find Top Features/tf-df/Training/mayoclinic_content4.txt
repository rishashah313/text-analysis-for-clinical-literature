b'Levonorgestrel (Intrauterine Route) Side Effects - Mayo Clinic\nDrugs and SupplementsLevonorgestrel (Intrauterine Route)\nDescription and Brand NamesDrug information provided by: IBM MicromedexUS Brand Name\nLilettaMirenaSkyla\nDescriptionsLevonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is a device that contains the female hormone, levonorgestrel. It is placed in the uterus (womb) where it slowly releases the hormone to prevent pregnancy for up to 3 years for Skyla\xc2\xae or up to 5 years for Kyleena\xe2\x84\xa2, Liletta\xc2\xae, or Mirena\xc2\xae. It works by stopping a woman\'s egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.\nLevonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is also used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding in women who choose this device as their method for birth control.\nThis medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.\nThis product is available in the following dosage forms:\nInsert, Extended Release\nBefore Using\nIn deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:\nAbnormal or unusual vaginal bleeding or\nAbnormally-shaped uterus or uterine fibroids or\nBreast cancer, known or suspected, or a history of or\nCancer of the uterus or cervix, known or suspected or\nGenital tract infections (eg, bacterial vaginosis, cervicitis, endometritis, vaginitis), acute and untreated or\nInfection (eg, leukemia, pneumonia, HIV/AIDS) or\nLiver disease, including tumors or cancer or\nPelvic infection (active or untreated), history of or\nPelvic inflammatory disease (a serious pelvic infection) or endometritis, or history of\xe2\x80\x94Should not be used in patients with these conditions.\nBleeding problems or\nBlood clots or\nDiabetes or\nHeart attack, history of or\nHeart disease or other heart problems (eg, congenital heart disease, heart valve problems) or\nHypertension (high blood pressure), severe or\nMigraine headaches, severe or\nOvarian cysts or\nStroke, history of\xe2\x80\x94Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.\nEctopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterus), history of or\nPelvic infection or\nTubal surgery, history of\xe2\x80\x94May increase the risk of having ectopic pregnancy.\nProper Use\nYour doctor will give you this medicine in a hospital or clinic. This intrauterine device (IUD) is inserted into your uterus.\nThis medicine comes with a patient information insert. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\nYour doctor may want to do tests to make sure you do not have an infection before putting in an IUD. The IUD is usually inserted during your monthly period, immediately after a miscarriage or an abortion in the first trimester of your pregnancy, at least 4 to 6 weeks after a miscarriage or an abortion in the second trimester of your pregnancy, or at least 4 to 6 weeks after giving birth. Putting an IUD in during a monthly period also helps to make sure that you are not pregnant. You will also need to see your doctor within 4 to 6 weeks of having your IUD inserted and then once a year. Use another form of birth control or refrain from having sex if the IUD is not inserted during the first 7 days of your menstrual cycle.\nLevonorgestrel IUD has a string or "tail" which is made of plastic thread. About one or two inches of this string hangs into your vagina. You cannot see this string, and it will not cause problems when you have sex. Check your IUD string every few days during the first few months that you have your IUD. After that, check the string after each monthly period. You may not be protected against pregnancy if you cannot feel the string or if you feel the plastic. Do the following to check the placement of your IUD:\nWash your hands with soap and warm water. Dry them with a clean towel.\nBend your knees and squat low to the ground.\nGently put your index (pointing) finger high inside your vagina. The cervix is at the top of the vagina and feels like the tip of your nose. Find the IUD string coming from your cervix. Never pull on the string. You should not be able to feel the firm plastic of the IUD itself.\nWash your hands after you are finished checking your IUD.\nYou will need to have your levonorgestrel-releasing IUD replaced every 3 years for Skyla\xc2\xae or 5 years for Kyleena\xe2\x84\xa2, Liletta\xc2\xae, or Mirena\xc2\xae, or sooner if it comes out of your uterus unexpectedly.\nIf you are using Kyleena\xe2\x84\xa2, Liletta\xc2\xae, Mirena\xc2\xae, or Skyla\xc2\xae, and want to stop, your doctor can remove it at any time. However, you may become pregnant as soon as Kyleena\xe2\x84\xa2, Liletta\xc2\xae, Mirena\xc2\xae, or Skyla\xc2\xae is removed or if you have intercourse the week before Liletta\xc2\xae is removed. Use another form of birth control (eg, condoms, spermicides) or have a new IUD inserted at the same day of removal to keep from getting pregnant.\nPrecautions\nIt is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly and does not cause unwanted effects. These visits will usually be 4 to 6 weeks after insertion and then once a year, but some doctors would require them more often.\nCall your doctor right away if you think you have become pregnant while you are using this medicine. You may have a higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy (occurs outside the womb) if you get pregnant while your IUD is in place. This can be a serious and life-threatening condition. It can also cause problems that may make it harder for you to become pregnant in the future.\nAn IUD can slip partly or all the way out of your uterus without you knowing it. If this happens, you will have no protection against getting pregnant or you may have an increased risk for serious problems. This is more likely during the first year that you have your IUD, but it can happen at any time. Regularly checking the string of your IUD can tell you if it is still in place.\nYou may have some blood spotting and cramping during the first few weeks after the IUD has been inserted. These symptoms should go away within a few months. Rarely, the IUD may make a hole in the wall of your uterus when it is inserted. If this happens, check with your doctor right away.\nUsing Kyleena\xe2\x84\xa2, Liletta\xc2\xae, Mirena\xc2\xae, or Skyla\xc2\xae can increase your risk for severe infections, including sepsis. This is a rare and life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.\nAn IUD can increase your risk of having a serious infection of the female organs, called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or endometritis (pregnancy-related), which can be serious, even life threatening. This infection could cause scarring of the female organs, which may make it hard for you to become pregnant in the future, and can increase your risk of ectopic pregnancy.\nCall your doctor right away if you have flu-like symptoms, fever, chills, cramps, pain, bleeding, or fluid leaking from your vagina. These may be signs that you have an infection.\nThis medicine may also increase your risk of having ovarian cysts or breast cancer. Talk to your doctor if this concerns you.\nThis medicine may also increase your risk of having high blood pressure (hypertension), clotting problems, or serious heart and blood vessel problems such as a heart attack or stroke. Check with your doctor right away if you start having dizziness, fainting spells, severe tiredness, chest pain, trouble with breathing, sudden or severe headache, problems with vision, speech, or walking, or unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness.\nThis device will not protect you from getting HIV/AIDS, herpes, or other sexually transmitted diseases. Tell your doctor if you or your partner begins to have sexual intercourse with other people, or you or your partner tests positive for a sexually transmitted disease. If this is a concern for you, talk with your doctor.\nIt is important to tell your doctor that you are using this medicine before you have a medical procedure, such as magnetic resonance imaging or MRI.\nDo not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal (eg, St. John\'s wort) or vitamin supplements.\nSide Effects\nAlong with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\nCheck with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\nMore common\nAbsent, missed, or irregular menstrual periods\nlonger or heavier menstrual periods\nmild bloating\nstomach or pelvic pain\nstopping of menstrual bleeding\nunusually heavy or unexpected menstrual bleeding\nuterine bleeding between menstrual periods\nvaginal bleeding or spotting\nLess common\nBlurred vision\ncramps\ndizziness\nheadache\nheavy bleeding\nitching of the vagina or genital area\nnervousness\npain\npain during sexual intercourse\npale skin\npounding in the ears\nslow or fast heartbeat\nswelling\nthick, white vaginal discharge with mild or no odor\ntroubled breathing with exertion\nunusual bleeding or bruising\nunusual tiredness or weakness\nwhite or brownish vaginal discharge\nRare\nChills\nconfusion\ndizziness, lightheadedness, fainting\nfast heartbeat\nfast, weak pulse\nfever\npale, cold, clammy skin\nrapid, shallow breathing\nsudden increase in stomach or shoulder pain\nsweating\nunusual or large amount of vaginal bleeding\nIncidence not known\nClear or bloody discharge from the nipple\ndimpling of the breast skin\ndull or aching stomach pain\nfoul-smelling vaginal discharge\nincreased blood pressure\nincreased urge to urinate\ninverted nipple\nlarge, hive-like swelling on the face, eyelids, lips, tongue, throat, hands, legs, feet, or sex organs\nlump in the breast or under the arm\npain during urination\npersistent crusting or scaling of the nipple\nredness or swelling of the breast\nsevere stomach pain or cramping\nsharp pain on insertion\nshivering fever\nsores on the skin of the breast that does not heal\nSome side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention.
