How Does an IUD Work as Birth Control?
How Does an IUD Work as Birth Control?
"IUD" stands for intrauterine device, and it's one of the most effective kinds of birth control you can get. A doctor inserts a little IUD into your uterus, and then you’re protected from pregnancy for years. IUDs are super convenient and mistake­-proof: you get it and forget it. Your IUD can be removed any time you want, and your ability to get pregnant quickly returns.
