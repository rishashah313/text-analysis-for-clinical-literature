There are two types of FDA-approved emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs). Some ECPs can work when taken within five days of unprotected sex or when your birth control does not work correctly. Some ECPs are available without a prescription.\nExpand all\n|\nCollapse all\nWhat is emergency contraception?\nEmergency contraception is a method of birth control you can use if you had sex without using birth control or if your birth control method did not work correctly. You must use emergency contraception as soon as possible after unprotected sex.\nEmergency contraception pills are different from the abortion pill. If you are already pregnant, emergency contraception pills do not stop or harm your pregnancy.\nEmergency contraception has also been called the "morning-after pill," but you do not need to wait until the morning after unprotected sex to take it.\nEmergency contraception is not meant to be used for regular birth control. Talk to your doctor or nurse about regular birth control to help prevent pregnancy. Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned.1\nWhat types of emergency contraception pills are available?\nIn the United States, there are two types of FDA-approved ECPs available for emergency contraception:2,3\nella\xc2\xae (ulipristal acetate)\nPlan B One-Step\xc2\xae (LNG-only) \xe2\x80\x94 Plan B One-Step\xc2\xae has several generic versions. Some common generic versions include AfterPill\xe2\x84\xa2, My Way\xc2\xae, Next Choice One Dose\xe2\x84\xa2, and Take Action\xe2\x84\xa2.\nHow do emergency contraception pills prevent pregnancy?\nResearch shows that emergency contraception pills work mostly by preventing or delaying ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary). Less commonly, emergency contraception may prevent fertilization of the egg by the sperm if ovulation has already happened.4,5 If a fertilized egg has already implanted in your uterus (you are pregnant), emergency contraception pills will not stop or harm your pregnancy.6\nWhen should I think about using emergency contraception?\nConsider using emergency contraception if you had sex and:\nYou didn\'t use birth control\nYou think your birth control didn\'t work (see the list in the next section)\nConsider asking your doctor for a prescription for emergency contraception pills, or having some type of emergency contraception pill already at home or with you in case you need it.\nWhat does it mean for birth control to "fail" or not work correctly?\nDepending on the method of birth control you use, not working correctly means different things.\nBirth control method\nFailure rate\n(number of pregnancies per 100 women in a year)7\nExamples of what can go wrong with your birth control\nNatural planning method\n24 out of 100 women get pregnant\nYou have sex on the fertile days of your cycle and do not use another form of birth control (such as a condom or spermicide)\nCervical cap\n23 out of 100 women get pregnant\n(women who have given birth)\n13 out of 100 women get pregnant\n(women who have never given birth)8\nSlips off the cervix or has a tear/hole in the cap; is not used with spermicide\nMale condom\n18 out of 100 women get pregnant\nBreaks or comes off at any time during sex\nDiaphragm with spermicide\n12 out of 100 women get pregnant\nSlips out of place or has a tear or hole in it; is not used with a spermicide\nHormonal birth control pills\n9 out of 100 women get pregnant\nYou do not take a pill every day, as directed\nVaginal ring\n9 out of 100 women get pregnant\nYou put it in too late or take it out too soon during the month\nBirth control patch\n9 out of 100 women get pregnant\nYou put it on too late or take it off too soon during the month, or it does not stick to your skin correctly\nHormonal birth control shot\n6 out of 100 women get pregnant\nYou are more than two weeks late getting the shot\nIntrauterine device (IUD)\nLess than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant*\nComes out before you are ready for it to be removed\nImplantable rod\nLess than 1 out of 100 women get pregnant\nThe rod is not removed or replaced in time (up to three years after it is placed in your arm)\n*This number may be higher, depending on when the IUD came out and how long before it was noticed.\nHow do I get emergency contraception?\nIt depends on the type of emergency contraception you need.\nPlan B One-Step\xc2\xae and similar generic versions are available in stores without a prescription to anyone, of any age. If you do not see it on the shelf, ask the pharmacist for help.\nLevonorgestrel tablets (two-pill generic Next Choice\xc2\xae and LNG tablets 0.75 mg) are available to people aged 17 and older without a prescription. These brands are sold from behind the pharmacy counter.\nella\xc2\xae is available only by prescription from your doctor, nurse, or family planning clinic.\nTo find a low-cost family planning clinic for emergency contraception, enter your ZIP code into the clinic finder on this page.\nHow quickly should I use emergency contraception after unprotected sex?\nEmergency contraception works best when you use it as soon as possible after unprotected sex. If you are unable to take it right away, emergency contraception can still work to prevent pregnancy if taken up to three to five days after unprotected sex. How long after depends on which type of emergency contraception you use.\nTake Plan B One-Step\xc2\xae or a generic version as soon as possible within three days (or 72 hours) after unprotected sex.\nFor the two-dose version (Next Choice\xc2\xae, LNG tablets 0.75 mg), take one pill as soon as possible within 3 days and the second pill 12 hours later.\nTake ella\xc2\xae (ulipristal acetate) as soon as possible within five days (or 120 hours) after unprotected sex.\nDoes emergency contraception have side effects?\nYes, but the side effects are rarely serious. Side effects differ for each woman and may include:\nHeadache\nAbdominal pain\nTiredness (fatigue)\nDizziness\nNausea\nBreast pain\nThe side effects are usually mild and do not last long. Your next period may come early or late, and you may have spotting (light bleeding that happens between menstrual periods).\nDoes body weight affect how well emergency contraception works for women?\nMaybe. Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that ECPs may not prevent pregnancy as often for obese women (with a body mass index, or BMI, of 30 or greater) as for women who are not obese.9\nFind out your BMI. If your BMI is greater than 30, talk to your doctor or nurse about your risk and your options for emergency contraception.\nHow can I get free or low-cost emergency contraception?\nUnder the Affordable Care Act (the health care law), most insurance plans cover FDA-approved prescriptions for emergency contraception and birth control at no cost to you. This includes Plan B One-Step\xc2\xae and ella\xc2\xae. Since you can buy Plan B One-Step\xc2\xae or the generic version in a store, without a prescription, call your insurance company to find out if your plan covers over-the-counter emergency contraception. You may need to get a prescription from your doctor if you want your insurance plan to pay for it.\nIf you have insurance, check with your insurance provider to find out what\'s included in your plan.\nIf you have Medicaid, your insurance may cover emergency contraception. Coverage varies between states, so check with your state\'s Medicaid program to learn about your benefits.\nIf you don\'t have insurance, find a family planning clinic in your area. They may provide emergency contraception for free or at low cost.\nTo see if you are eligible for low-cost or no-cost health insurance, visit HealthCare.gov.\nFor information about other services covered by the Affordable Care Act, visit HealthCare.gov.\nCan I get emergency contraception pills before I need them?\nYes. Your doctor can give you a prescription to fill so you can have emergency contraception at home to use when you need it. Or, you can buy some types of emergency contraception pills from a store at any time.\nCan I use emergency contraception as my regular form of birth control?\nNo. Do not use Plan B One-Step\xc2\xae (or a generic version) or ella\xc2\xae as your regular birth control. Most other types of FDA-approved birth control, when used correctly, are much better at preventing pregnancy than emergency contraception pills and usually cost less. Also, while emergency contraception pills are safe for emergency use, they have not been tested as regular birth control and are not approved by the FDA for this purpose.\nWomen who are sexually active will need to use birth control to prevent pregnancy. What type of regular birth control you can use right away depends on the type of emergency contraception you take.\nIf you take ella\xc2\xae, do not use hormonal birth control (the pill, patch, vaginal ring, or intrauterine device) for at least five days after you take ella. Using them together may cause ella\xc2\xae not to work. Instead, use a condom, diaphragm, sponge, or cervical cap until you get your next period.10\nIf you take Plan B One-Step\xc2\xae (or a generic version), you can start right away or continue using a regular form of birth control.\nRead more about different types of birth control in our birth control methods fact sheet.\nWill emergency contraception pills affect my next period?\nMaybe. After you take an emergency contraception pill, your next period may come sooner or later than normal. Most women will get their period within a week of the expected date. Your period also may be heavier, lighter, spotty, and more or less painful than is normal for you.\nIf you do not get your period more than one week after expected or if you think you might be pregnant after taking emergency contraception pills, take a pregnancy test to find out for sure.\nWill emergency contraception protect me from sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?\nNo. Emergency contraception does not protect you from STIs. To lower your risk of getting an STI, always use condoms when you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex.\nSee a doctor right away if you think you may have been exposed to an STI. \xc2\xa0Also, you can get medicine to help prevent HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\nIf you were sexually assaulted, go to the nearest hospital emergency room as soon as possible. The National Sexual Assault Hotline (link is external) at 800-656-HOPE (4673) can help you find a hospital able to collect evidence of sexual assault. You can get medicine to prevent HIV and other STIs and get emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy.\nDid we answer your question about emergency contraception?\nFor more information about emergency contraception, call the OWH Helpline at 1-800-994-9662 or contact the following organizations:\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA), HHS\nPhone Number: 888-463-6332\nOffice of Population Affairs, HHS\nPhone Number: 240-453-2888\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (link is external)\nPhone Number: 800-762-2264 x 349 (for publications requests only)\nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America (link is external)\nPhone Number: 800-230-7526\nThe Emergency Contraception Website, Princeton University and the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals (link is external)\nSources\nFiner, L.B., Zolna, M.R.
