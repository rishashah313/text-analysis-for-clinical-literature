The latest addition is a hormonal IUD called LILETTA.\nupdated\n02/08/2017\nUpdate: LILETTA is no longer the newest IUD to hit the market. Another hormonal IUD, Kyleena, became available in 2016. Learn more about Kyleena and read the latest about LILETTA.\n\xe2\x80\x94\nAs the use of IUDs in the U.S. has gone up, so has the number of IUD options on the market. The latest to join the party is called LILETTA, and it will be coming soon to a health care provider near you.\nWho can use LILETTA? And how well does it work?\nJust like other IUDs, LILETTA is safe for most women to use. Important exceptions are women with an untreated uterine infection or women with breast, uterine, or cervical cancer.\nThe big study to measure LILETTA\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness included women with and without kids.\nThat means the label says straight out that women without kids can safely use LILETTA. The study also included women of all shapes and sizes, so we know for certain that LILETTA works well for women of any weight.\nOut of 100 women using LILETTA, less than one of them will have an accidental pregnancy in a year. That makes LILETTA one of the most effective\nbirth control options, right up there with other IUDs and the implant.\nHow does LILETTA work?\nLiletta works the same way as Mirena and Skyla, by releasing a steady, low level of the hormone levonorgestrel into the uterus.\nLILETTA releases about 19 micrograms per day for the first year, compared to about 20 micrograms per day with Mirena and 14 with Skyla.\nMost of the hormone stays in the uterus, but there is a measureable amount of it in the in the blood too (0.0002 micrograms per milliliter). All of these hormonal IUDs prevent pregnancy by thickening the cervical mucus and blocking sperm.\nWhat about side effects and benefits?\nThe most common side effect of LILETTA is that one in five women stop having a period after a year of use. Depending on how you feel about periods, this could be a drawback or a serious benefit. Women in the study reported a variety of other side effects. The way the study was designed, we just don\xe2\x80\x99t know which of them were caused by LILETTA versus being caused by something else. That said, the most commonly reported side effects included discomfort in the belly or pelvis (13%), acne (12%), headache (10%), nausea (8%), and breast tenderness (7%).\nThe most common risk was expulsion: about 4% of women in the study had an expulsion, which is similar to other IUDs.\nHow long does LILETTA last?\nLike with all IUDs, a health care provider can remove LILETTA any time, for whatever reason. LILETTA contains a similar amount of levonorgestrel to Mirena and releases it at a similar rate. The Mirena label says it can be used for 5 years, and research shows it can be used for up to 6 years. So why does LILETTA\xe2\x80\x99s label only say it can be used for up to 3 years? Here\xe2\x80\x99s the scoop.\nThe company behind LILETTA, a non-profit pharmaceutical company called Medicines360, wanted to get LILETTA out there as soon as they had proof it was safe and effective, so they asked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to review it as soon as they had information about women\xe2\x80\x99s experiences of using it for 3 years. Their study is still going and has already shown the LILETTA works for up to 5 years. They plan to collect information about women\xe2\x80\x99s experiences with LILETTA for up to 7 years. Meanwhile, the FDA will consider the new information and decide whether to increase LILETTA\xe2\x80\x99s approved use to 5 years.\nWhat will LILETTA cost and how can I get it?\nWithout any discount, LILETTA costs up to $684\xe2\x80\x94about the same as Skyla\xe2\x80\x94but there\xe2\x80\x99s a very good chance you can get a discount. There are a number of ways people with and without insurance can get LILETTA for free or at a lower price. We\xe2\x80\x99re not the only ones who are excited about this. In the words of Family Nurse Practitioner Patty Cason: \xe2\x80\x9cI am thrilled that the FDA has approved this new intrauterine contraceptive option, and that more women will have affordable access to this great birth control.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor women without health coverage: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have health insurance, look for a Title X family planning clinic near you. These clinics offer sliding scale fees for their services, and they will be able to purchase the LILETTA IUD for only $50. That means they can pass the savings along to their patients. Contact your nearest Title X clinic to find out what LILETTA will cost for you.\nFor women with health coverage: LILETTA should be covered by insurance without a copay, just like other types of prescription birth control. Note that it may not be covered by insurance plans immediately, since it usually takes a few months for plans to get new drugs and devices on their list of approved treatments (called a \xe2\x80\x9cformulary\xe2\x80\x9d). For Medicaid plans, it can take up to a year to get new things on the formulary.\nIf you have health insurance but your plan still charges a copay or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cover birth control at all, LILETTA is offering a Patient Savings Program until December 31, 2017. Ask your health care provider if they are participating. The program only covers the IUD itself, not the cost of having the IUD inserted (usually between $150 and $250). Here\xe2\x80\x99s how it works:\nBefore getting the IUD: Talk to your provider about getting a LILETTA Access Card. This is like a debit card that can only be used to purchase a LILETTA. It reduces the cost of the device to somewhere between $75 and $125, depending on the details of your health insurance plan. After your health care provider has written a prescription for the IUD and given you a card, you can use the card to pay for the IUD.\nAfter getting the IUD: If you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about the Access Card and paid full price out-of-pocket for LILETTA, make sure you get an \xe2\x80\x9cexplanation of benefits\xe2\x80\x9d (EOB) bill from your insurance company. Once you have the EOB, call 855-706-4508 to arrange a rebate of up to $500. The total rebate will depend on how much you paid for the LILETTA.\nread more about:\nIUD, effectiveness, cost, birth control\nread our commenting policy \xc2\xbb\nA NOTE ABOUT COMMENTING /\nWe trust that sexy brain of yours to post with good intentions.
