Can I get an IUD?
Most people can use IUDs safely, but there are some conditions that make side effects or complications more likely. Talk to your nurse or doctor to find out if IUDs are safe for you.
You may not be able to get an IUD if you
have certain STDs or pelvic infection
think you might be pregnant
have cervical cancer that hasn't been treated
have cancer of the uterus
have had a pelvic infection after either childbirth or an abortion in the past 3 months
You also shouldn't get a Paragard IUD if you have a copper allergy, Wilson's Disease, or a bleeding disorder that makes it hard for your blood to clot.  And you shouldn't get a hormonal IUD if you have had breast cancer.
Very rarely, the size or shape of someone’s uterus makes it hard to place an IUD correctly.
If you have a condition that rules out an IUD for you, don’t worry. You’ve got lots of other birth control options.
What are the risks of an IUD?
There are possible risks with an IUD, but serious problems are really rare.
The IUD can sometimes slip out of the uterus — it can come all the way out or just a little bit. If this happens, you can get pregnant. If the IUD only comes out part of the way, it has to be removed.
It is possible — though extremely unlikely — to get pregnant even if the IUD is in the right spot. If you get pregnant, you should have the IUD removed as soon as you find out. If you get pregnant with an IUD in place, there’s an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy and other serious health problems.
It’s possible to get an infection if bacteria get into the uterus when the IUD is put in. If the infection isn't treated, it may affect your chances of getting pregnant in the future.
When the IUD is put in, it could push through the wall of the uterus. This sounds painful, but it usually doesn't hurt. But if this happens, you could need surgery to remove the IUD. This is very rare.
What warning signs should I know about?
Chances are that you’ll have no problems with your IUD. But it's still important to pay attention to your body and how you feel after you get your IUD. Here are the warning signs to watch out for. Call your nurse or doctor right away if:
the length of your IUD string feels shorter or longer than it was
you can feel the hard plastic bottom of the IUD coming out through your cervix
you think you might be pregnant
you have bad cramping, pain, or soreness in your lower belly or stomach
there’s pain or bleeding during sex
you get unexplained fever, chills, or have trouble breathing
your vaginal discharge is different than normal
you have vaginal bleeding that is heavier than usual
If you have unprotected sex with someone who has an STD, see your nurse or doctor for any tests or treatments you may need.
Is it safe to use the IUD while breastfeeding?
Yes, it’s safe to use the IUD while you’re breastfeeding.  It shouldn’t have any effect on how much milk you produce, and it won’t hurt your baby. In fact, the IUD is a great method to use if you’re breastfeeding and you don’t want to get pregnant.
