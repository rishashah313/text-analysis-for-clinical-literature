Sounds odd, but it works like a charm. IUDs offer years of protection\xe2\x80\x94between three and twelve, depending on the type you get. And if you want to get pregnant, you can have the IUD removed at any time. In the U.S. there are five IUDs: Mirena, Paragard, Skyla, LILETTA, and Kyleena.\nview all methods \xc2\xbb\ntypes of IUDs\nHormonal\nThere are four hormonal IUDs available in the U.S.\xe2\x80\x94Mirena, Skyla, LILETTA, and Kyleena. All three are made of plastic and release a small amount of the synthetic hormone progestin, which thickens your cervical mucus to keep sperm from reaching the uterus. Depending what kind you get, hormonal IUDs can last between 3 and 6 years and may make your periods lighter.\nNon-Hormonal\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s only one IUD without hormones available in the U.S. It\xe2\x80\x99s called ParaGard and it\xe2\x80\x99s made of plastic and a small amount of natural, safe copper. ParaGard doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect your periods and can work for up to 12 years.\nreal stories\nYou know, you kinda have to bear through it until your uterus is like, \'okay, we\'re friends, we\'re gonna work together.\'\nDoes it hurt to get an IUD?\nIUD\nI love being able to say I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a period since I was 17 years old.\nellie, 27\nIUD\nHonestly, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s so worth it.\ntika, 19\nIUD\nI never even think about it being there.\nlindsay, 30\nIUD\nTake care of your vaginal health as much as you can.\nmal, 30\nIUD\nThe likes far outweigh the don\xe2\x80\x99t likes.\njohanna, 28\nIUD\nMy partner does not feel the strings.\nevelyn, 28\nIUD\nBirth control\xe2\x80\xa6for a woman it\xe2\x80\x99s like revolutionary.\njannette, 29\nIUD\nThe actual insertion did not bother me at all.\ndaria, 20\nIUD\nDay through day, night through night, I\xe2\x80\x99m covered.\ntabitha, 20\nIUD\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s one less thing to worry about, which is really awesome.\ngeorge, 22\nIUD\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s hassle-free.

Once it\xe2\x80\x99s in, you\xe2\x80\x99re good to go for anywhere from 3 to 12 years.\nHands free\nNo packages or prescriptions to pick up at the pharmacy, so there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that could get lost or forgotten.\nTotal privacy\nNo one can tell when you have an IUD. (Some partners say they can feel the strings, but no one else will know it\xe2\x80\x99s there.) There\xe2\x80\x99s no tell-tale packaging, and nothing you need to do just before you have sex.\nSafe and sound\nMost experts agree, if you\xe2\x80\x99re healthy and have a uterus, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably a good candidate for the IUD. That\xe2\x80\x99s true even if you\xe2\x80\x99re young, haven\xe2\x80\x99t ever been pregnant, or haven\xe2\x80\x99t had kids yet. It\xe2\x80\x99s also a great method for new moms (even if you\xe2\x80\x99re breastfeeding).\nThe pregnancy question\nYou should return to fertility (fancy way of saying you should go back to being able to get pregnant) very quickly after you have the IUD removed. Which is great if you want to have a baby. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re not ready to get pregnant as soon as you have an IUD taken out, be sure to protect yourself with an alternate method.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t take our word for it. Check out the videos above to hear people talk about their experiences with the IUD. And be sure to ask your health care provider which method is best for you.\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, if you have health insurance, chances are good that you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to get this method with no out-of-pocket cost.\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t have insurance or Medicaid, this method can be pricey up front. Still, the IUD can stay in place for years, so it becomes downright cheap over time.\nPrices for Mirena or Kyleena*\nThis method may be free or low-cost for you\nWith Medicaid: Free\nWith insurance: Free under most plans\nWithout insurance: Depending on your income, you may be able to go to a low-cost clinic to get Mirena or Kyleena at reduced cost. Bayer, the company that makes the Mirena and Kyleena IUDs, works with health care providers to supply a certain number of free IUDs to women who qualify. If you qualify, ask your health care provider to help you apply.\nThe full price of Mirena and Kyleena can range from $500 - $858. To see how this translates over a year, here\xe2\x80\x99s what it would cost to pay for one of these IUDs month-to-month at full price.\nCost per month over one year: $41 - $72\nCost per month over five years: $8 - $14\nPrices for Paragard*\nThis method may be free or low-cost for you\nWith Medicaid: Free\nWith insurance: Free under most plans\nWithout insurance: Depending on your income, you may be able to go to a low-cost clinic to get Paragard at reduced cost.\nThe full price of Paragard can range from $500 - $739. To see how this translates over a year, here\xe2\x80\x99s what it would cost to pay for Paragard month-to-month at full price.\nCost per month over one year: $41 - $62\nCost per month over five years: $8 - $12\nCost per month over 10 years: $4 - $6\nPayment assistance: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have insurance, the manufacturer offers payment plans where you can make 4 or 12 monthly payments. Contact the manufacturer at Paragard.com or 1-877-727-2427 to find out more. Also, check with your local family planning clinics to find out if they offer free or low-cost IUDs (many do).\nPrices for Skyla*\nThis method may be free or low-cost for you\nWith Medicaid: Free\nWith insurance: Free under most plans\nWithout insurance: Depending on your income, you may be able to go to a low-cost clinic to get it at reduced cost. Bayer, the company that makes the Skyla IUD, also has a program to offer a certain number of free IUDs to people who can\xe2\x80\x99t afford one otherwise. (Note that you have to work with a health care provider to apply to the program.)\nThe full price of Skyla can range from $650 - $714. To see how this translates over a year, here\xe2\x80\x99s what it would cost to pay for Skyla month-to-month at full price.\nCost per month over one year: $54 - $60\nCost per month over three years: $18 - $20\nPrices for LILETTA*\nThis method may be free or low-cost for you\nWith Medicaid: Free\nWith insurance: Free under most plans. If your plan has a high copay, you may qualify for copay assistance that reduces the cost of the device to $75.\nWithout insurance: Depending on your income, you may be able to go to a low-cost clinic to get it at reduced cost or even for free.\nThe full price of LILETTA can range from $50-$684. There is also an out-of-pocket maximum of $75 with certain insurance plans. To see how this translates over a year, here\xe2\x80\x99s what it would cost to pay for LILETTA month-to-month at full price.\nCost per month over one year: $4 - $57\nCost per month over three years: $1 - $19\n*Note: Without insurance there may be an additional cost for your health care provider to insert or remove an IUD. The average cost for these visits is around $150 to $250, depending on the service. For those with insurance, insertion should always be covered, but removal might not always be covered.\nIf you want to get an IUD, the first thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to do is talk with your health care provider. They will ask you a bunch of questions about your medical history and your lifestyle, then give you an exam to make sure the IUD is right for you.\nYou can get the IUD inserted any time of the month.\nSome providers like to insert it during your period, but any time is fine as long as you can be sure you\xe2\x80\x99re not pregnant.\nIt may be the most comfortable to get it done during the middle of your period, if you can believe that. (That\xe2\x80\x99s when your cervix\xe2\x80\x94the opening to your uterus\xe2\x80\x94is open the most.)\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s pretty common to feel some cramps when you get an IUD inserted, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll go away with rest or pain medication. Some people might feel dizzy, too. Once the IUD is in, you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice a little string that hangs down into your vagina. That\xe2\x80\x99s there so that the IUD can be removed later. (The strings don\xe2\x80\x99t hang out of the vagina like a tampon, though.)\nAfter it\xe2\x80\x99s in, there\xe2\x80\x99s really not much you have to do other than check the string ends from time to time to make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s in place. Here\xe2\x80\x99s how:\nWash your hands, then sit or squat down.\nPut your finger in your vagina until you touch your cervix, which will feel firm and rubbery like the tip of your nose.\nFeel for the strings. If you find them, congrats! Your IUD is good to go. But if you feel the hard part of the IUD against your cervix, you may need to have it adjusted or replaced by your provider.\np.s. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tug on the strings! If you do, the IUD could move out of place.\np.p.s. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel comfortable checking for the strings, you can let your provider do that the month after insertion, and then yearly after that.\nThere are positive and negative things to say about each and every method. And everyone\xe2\x80\x99s different\xe2\x80\x94so what you experience may not be the same as what your friend experiences.\nThe Positive\nPositive \xe2\x80\x9cside effects\xe2\x80\x9d? You bet. There are actually lots of things about birth control that are good for your body as well as your sex life.\nThe Negative\nEveryone worries about negative side effects, but for many people, they\xe2\x80\x99re not a problem. Most people adjust to having an IUD pretty quickly, but give yourself time. It could take a few months.\nEasy to use\nDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt the heat of the moment\nSuper long-lasting protection without much effort\nSafe for smokers and those with hypertension and diabetes\nThe Paragard brand of IUD doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change your hormone levels\nThe progestin IUDs may reduce cramps and make your period lighter. (Some people\xe2\x80\x99s periods stop completely.)\nYou can use it while you\xe2\x80\x99re breastfeeding\nThe most common complaints:\nSpotting between periods (especially during the first few months after you get an IUD)\nIncreased period flow (for users of the Paragard brand)\nCramps and backaches\nOther stuff to watch out for:\nIUD slipping out\nInfection\nIUD pushing through the wall of the uterus\nIf you still feel uncomfortable after three months, switch methods and stay protected. You\xe2\x80\x99re worth it.\n*For a very small number of people there are risks of serious side effects.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re here to get this method working better for you. And if it still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel right, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got ideas for other methods. Just remember: If you change methods, make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re protected while you switch.\n...I\'m spotting a lot\xe2\x80\x94should I be concerned?\nSpotting, which can happen with a bunch of different methods, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make you lose that much blood, even though it might seem like it.\nWe have a Provider Perspective article about it if you want to learn more.\nStill not working?\nYou may have more luck on a pill with a slightly higher dose of estrogen, or one that provides estrogen during a different part of your cycle.\nTry a different method\n...My IUD was expelled. What\'s the likelihood it\'ll happen again?\nIUD expulsion can occur in 2-10% of people in the first year after insertion. Expulsion can be more likely for people who:\nHaven\xe2\x80\x99t been pregnant\nAre younger than 20 years\nHave a history of very heavy or very painful periods (though be mindful that these are reasons doctors recommend the hormonal IUD in the first place\xe2\x80\xa6)\nHad the IUD put in right after giving birth or having a 2nd trimester abortion.\nA partial expulsion may mean that the IUD was not quite in the right position: it may have been too low in the uterus and just worked its way out. This could be something that happened around the time of insertion, or may be related to uterine characteristics, such as size, angle, or presence of conditions like fibroids that can cause irregular shape.\nFor people who have an IUD expulsion, the chance of expelling a 2nd IUD may be higher\xe2\x80\x94in the 20% range (up to 30% in some studies).\nIf you want a second IUD after the first one came out, consider asking your health care provider about inserting the 2nd IUD while using an ultrasound machine to make sure the IUD is inserted all the way to the fundus.\nStill not working?\nIf you like the ease of using an IUD, but are having problems with expulsion, you could try switching to the implant\xe2\x80\x94a long-acting and low-maintenance option.\nTry a different method\n...I heard there\'s a risk in using tampons with an IUD.\nAs far as tampons and IUDs go, Planned Parenthood puts it like this: \xe2\x80\x9cTampons and IUDs are kind of like next-door neighbors. They\xe2\x80\x99re close but they live in different parts of the reproductive system. An IUD and a tampon are separated by the cervix, and don\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with each other\xe2\x80\x99s business.\xe2\x80\x9d\nYou should be fine as long as you are careful not to pull on the IUD strings, which you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need to worry about too much since the string of a tampon are outside of your vagina and the strings of your IUD should be up near your cervix. (If you find that your IUD strings are anywhere near your tampon strings, you should go see your health care provider because your IUD might be expelled.)\n...I heard the non-hormonal IUD can cause copper toxicity.\nIUDs are safe for most people with a uterus, and copper toxicity is super rare. That said, it can happen, especially in people with Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s Disease, a rare genetic condition (about 1 in every 30,000 to 40,000 people have it) that affects your body\xe2\x80\x99s ability to process copper. Given how low the daily dose of copper is from the non-hormonal IUD, it is extremely unlikely that someone who does not have Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s Disease would experience copper toxicity.\n...My partner can feel my IUD strings.\nThe strings of the IUD usually get softer over time, but if they\xe2\x80\x99re really a problem for your partner, talk to your health care provider about adjusting them or cutting them shorter.\n...I\'m ready to get my IUD out. Can I remove it myself?\nYou may be able to find some stories online about people removing their own IUD, but we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend trying it. There just isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough research at this point to know if it\xe2\x80\x99s safe.\nPlus, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not happy with your IUD, going to your health care provider to get it removed will give you a chance to ask about other options for birth control. Or if you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to get pregnant, you can talk with your provider about things you should do to prepare for a healthy pregnancy.\nStill not working?\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re not happy with the IUD but you\xe2\x80\x99re not ready to get pregnant, you may want to consider a different kind of IUD (there are three!) if you\xe2\x80\x99ve only tried one. If you want something that lasts for a while and is easy to use, the implant might be another good option.\nTry a different method\n...I want to get pregnant.\nThis one is easy. If you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to get pregnant, just have your IUD removed. The hormones in your body should go back to normal quickly and you can start trying right away.\n...I\'m worried that my IUD will hurt my partner.\nThe IUD shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt your partner. You may have heard that the IUD strings can bother partners while having sex, but most partners can\xe2\x80\x99t even feel the strings. If your partner can feel the strings, and that bothers them, your healthcare provider might be able to trim them. Plus, they usually soften over time.\n...I think my birth control is affecting my mood.\nIf you feel like your birth control is changing your behavior, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to talk to your health care provider. Everybody responds to birth control differently, and your provider can help you decide whether it\xe2\x80\x99s time to try something else. It might be a matter of switching hormonal methods or deciding whether to avoid hormonal birth control altogether, or you may choose to wait it out since some negative side effects go away with time. The bottom line: If your current method is making you feel blah, don\xe2\x80\x99t settle. There are a lot of methods to choose from and sometimes it can take a few tries to get it right.\n...My periods are heavier and/or my cramps are worse.\nIf this is the case, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably using a copper IUD (Paragard). Sometimes things get better if you just give it a couple months. You can also take ibuprofen the first few days of your period.\nStill not working?\nIf you like the ease of using an IUD, but find that the side effects don\xe2\x80\x99t get better with time or painkillers, you could try switching to a hormonal IUD (Mirena) or to the implant.\nTry a different method\n...I heard there\'s a risk in using a menstrual cup with an IUD.\nAs long as you\xe2\x80\x99re careful to avoid suction or pulling your IUD strings when you remove your menstrual cup, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine to use a cup and an IUD together. A recent study found that the \xe2\x80\x9cuse of tampons or menstrual cups does not increase the risk of early expulsion of an IUD.\xe2\x80\x9d The packaging information for IUDs can be inconsistent, but women \xe2\x80\x9ccan use whatever their usual menstrual product is and not increase their risk of expelling the IUD.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMenstrual cup brands are in agreement about this. DivaCup, MoonCup/Keeper, MeLuna, Lunette, and SoftCup say that because of the physical placement of your cup, you should be fine combining one with an IUD. If you can, try to double check with your health care provider first to be on the extra-safe side.\n...I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about removing my IUD myself.\nUnless you\xe2\x80\x99re on a desert island or stranded in some kind of post-apocalyptic-last-person-on-earth scenario, we highly recommend having a professional do it. There are a lot of reasons why it\xe2\x80\x99s better (and safer) to have your health care provider remove your IUD for you.\n...I\'m afraid that getting the IUD inserted will hurt.\nIUD insertion pain can vary from person to person, but unfortunately there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a great drug to take to make insertion less painful.\nYou can try taking ibuprofen beforehand, and make sure you get the IUD inserted when your cervix is open, such as when you\xe2\x80\x99re on your period or ovulating. Even if there is some pain, it might be worth it for years of worry-free boot knocking.\nThese 8 stories make us want to shout "Thanks, Birth Control" from the rooftops\nWe laughed, we cried, we didn\'t get pregnant\nread the full article \xc2\xbb\nWhy I use a diaphragm for birth control in 2019\nThe diaphragm is hormone-free and gives me total control\nread the full article \xc2\xbb\nSex in the news: October 2019 edition\nread the full article \xc2\xbb\nFour plus-size women share the birth control methods that work for them and why\nBecause birth control isn\'t one-size-fits-all\nread the full article \xc2\xbb\nshow more related articles \xc2\xbb\nquick facts /\nInvisible and easy.
