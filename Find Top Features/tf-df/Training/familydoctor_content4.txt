It is an injection, or shot, that contains progestin. This is a natural hormone that your ovaries produce each month as part of your menstrual cycle. You must get it from your primary care or women\xe2\x80\x99s doctor. They give you the injection in either your upper arm or buttock. It can go into a muscle (intramuscular) or under your skin (subcutaneous).\nDepo-Provera prevents pregnancy by stopping ovulation (the release of an egg by your ovaries). It thickens your cervical mucus, which makes it hard for sperm to reach and fertilize an egg. It also thins your uterine lining, which makes it hard for a fertilized egg to implant, or attach, to your uterus.\nPath to improved health\nDepo-Provera works for about 3 months at a time. To prevent pregnancy, you have to get 1 shot from your doctor 4 times a year, about 12 to 14 weeks apart. If you get it in the first 7 days of your cycle, it works right away. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to use another form of birth control for 1 week. Your doctor will confirm you are not pregnant before giving you the injection.\nMost women who use Depo-Provera have changes in their menstrual periods. These may include:\nbleeding or spotting between menstrual periods\nan increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding\nno menstrual bleeding at all.\nAbout half of women who use Depo-Provera stop having periods after 1 year. This is not harmful. Menstrual bleeding usually returns to normal when you stop using Depo-Provera. It may take about 9 to 10 months to get pregnant after your last shot.\nContact your doctor right away if you have abnormally heavy or nonstop bleeding. Other possible side effects of Depo-Provera include:\nweight gain\nheadaches\nnervousness\nabdominal pain\ndizziness\nweakness or fatigue\nosteoporosis (loss of bone density)\nblood clots\nchance of an ectopic pregnancy. This occurs when an egg fertilizes outside of your uterus. It is rare, but can be harmful for a woman.\nThings to consider\nDue to an increased risk of osteoporosis, you should limit the use of Depo-Provera to 2 years. Eat foods high in vitamin D and calcium to increase your bone density. Depo-Provera may increase your chance of having breast cancer if you begin using it before the age of 35.\nWomen who are breastfeeding can use Depo-Provera. You should not use it if you are pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or have:\nhigh blood pressure\nheart, kidney, or liver disease\nbreast cancer\na history of heart attack or stroke\nunknown vaginal bleeding\nan allergy to the drug in Depo-Provera.\nDepo-Provera is effective at preventing pregnancy if you get the shots on time. The success rate is more than 99%. It is as effective as having a tubal ligation (getting your \xe2\x80\x9ctubes tied\xe2\x80\x9d). The success rate can be higher than other forms of birth control, including diaphragms, condoms, and pills. Depo-Provera does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). You and/or your partner still should use condoms to prevent getting an STD.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nHow do I know if Depo-Provera is right for me, or if I should use another form of birth control?\nDoes my age play a factor in using Depo-Provera?\nHow long can I take Depo-Provera?\nDoes my insurance cover Depo-Provera?\nResources\nNational Institutes of Health: MedlinePlus, Medroxyprogesterone Injection\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration, Birth Control: Medicines to Help You\nLast Updated: May 10, 2017\nThis article was contributed by familydoctor.org editorial staff.\nCategories: Birth Control, Prevention and Wellness, Sex and Birth ControlTags: female, gynecologic September 1, 2000\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.
