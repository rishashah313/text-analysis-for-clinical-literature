IUDs and implants are low-maintenance, highly effective birth control. Click to learn more about each:

The IUD
IUD stands for Intrauterine Device (basically: a device inside your uterus). It's a small piece of flexible plastic shaped like a T that is inserted by a doctor. It’s long-term, reversible, and one of the most effective birth control methods out there.
There are two types of IUDs: Copper IUDs (Paragard) and Hormonal IUDs (Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla). The Paragard IUD doesn’t have hormones and protects you from pregnancy for up to 12 years. The Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla IUDs use the hormone progestin to prevent pregnancy and work from between 3-6 years.
IUDs - At A Glance
99% Effective
It's one of the most effective types of birth control. Less than 1 out of 100 people will get pregnant in one year using the implant.
Costs up to $1,300, but can be $0
The good news is IUDs can be totally free (or low cost) with many health insurance plans, Medicaid, and some other government programs.

The Implant
The birth control Implant (AKA Nexplanon) is a tiny, thin rod about the size of a matchstick. The implant releases hormones into your body that prevent you from getting pregnant. A nurse or doctor inserts the implant into your arm and that’s it — you’re protected from pregnancy for up to 4 years.
