This intrauterine device (IUD) is inserted into your uterus.\nThis medicine comes with a patient information insert. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.\nYour doctor may want to do tests to make sure you do not have an infection before putting in an IUD. The IUD is usually inserted during your monthly period, immediately after a miscarriage or an abortion in the first trimester of your pregnancy, at least 4 to 6 weeks after a miscarriage or an abortion in the second trimester of your pregnancy, or at least 4 to 6 weeks after giving birth. Putting an IUD in during a monthly period also helps to make sure that you are not pregnant. You will also need to see your doctor within 4 to 6 weeks of having your IUD inserted and then once a year. Use another form of birth control or refrain from having sex if the IUD is not inserted during the first 7 days of your menstrual cycle.\nLevonorgestrel IUD has a string or "tail" which is made of plastic thread. About one or two inches of this string hangs into your vagina. You cannot see this string, and it will not cause problems when you have sex. Check your IUD string every few days during the first few months that you have your IUD. After that, check the string after each monthly period. You may not be protected against pregnancy if you cannot feel the string or if you feel the plastic. Do the following to check the placement of your IUD:\nWash your hands with soap and warm water. Dry them with a clean towel.\nBend your knees and squat low to the ground.\nGently put your index (pointing) finger high inside your vagina. The cervix is at the top of the vagina and feels like the tip of your nose. Find the IUD string coming from your cervix. Never pull on the string. You should not be able to feel the firm plastic of the IUD itself.\nWash your hands after you are finished checking your IUD.\nYou will need to have your levonorgestrel-releasing IUD replaced every 3 years for Skyla\xc2\xae or 5 years for Kyleena\xe2\x84\xa2, Liletta\xc2\xae, or Mirena\xc2\xae, or sooner if it comes out of your uterus unexpectedly.\nIf you are using Kyleena\xe2\x84\xa2, Liletta\xc2\xae, Mirena\xc2\xae, or Skyla\xc2\xae, and want to stop, your doctor can remove it at any time. However, you may become pregnant as soon as Kyleena\xe2\x84\xa2, Liletta\xc2\xae, Mirena\xc2\xae, or Skyla\xc2\xae is removed or if you have intercourse the week before Liletta\xc2\xae is removed. Use another form of birth control (eg, condoms, spermicides) or have a new IUD inserted at the same day of removal to keep from getting pregnant.\nBefore UsingPrecautions\nPortions of this document last updated:\nNov. 01, 2019\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2019 IBM Watson Health.
