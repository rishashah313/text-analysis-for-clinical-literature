And we promise to respect your perspective, thoughts, insight, advice, humor, cheeky anecdotes, and tips. We\xe2\x80\x99ll even indulge a healthy rant or two. But we must ask that you cite your source if you want to challenge any scientific or technical information on Bedsider. And please note: We will not tolerate abusive comments, racism, personal attacks, or bullying. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we take our time to read every comment before it is posted. (That\xe2\x80\x99s also why there\xe2\x80\x99s some lag time before your comment shows up.) We greatly appreciate your presence here and welcome your participation 24/7/365. Just remember to be respectful and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be good to go.\nOh! One more thing: We do our best to answer questions in a timely manner, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee an immediate reply. (And we don\xe2\x80\x99t answer questions that are already answered in the article you\xe2\x80\x99re commenting on.) If you ask a question and need a response right now, we partner with San Francisco Sex Information (SFSI) to give you free, accurate, confidential info on sex and reproductive health. Their phone number is 415-989-SFSI (7374) and here are their hours. And if you have an urgent medical question, please contact your doctor or a local health center. We\xe2\x80\x99re here to help you stay informed, but only a medical professional can advise you on personal health concerns.\nmore videos /\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdd a dash of sperm and blammo!
