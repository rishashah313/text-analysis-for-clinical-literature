Yet somehow it continues to be a taboo subject. Social media platforms shy away from advertisements that discuss birth control in non-clinical terms. Certain politicians and media personalities talk about it like it\'s a luxury item rather than basic health care.\nHere\'s the thing about taboos: They make it easier for myths to spread and harder to get accurate information. Because having accurate information about birth control is crucial for a woman to take charge of her sexual health, I can think of no better way to honor National Women\'s Health Week than to share these five nerdy things everyone should know about birth control.\nThere are more methods than you think. That\'s been one of Bedsider\'s slogans since the beginning. We find that many people know about only a few of their birth control options (Hello, condoms and the pill). In fact, there are more than a dozen different birth control methods (link is external) \xe2\x80\x94 and even more options within those categories. And, bonus, because of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), most health insurance plans cover FDA approved birth control methods without having to pay a deductible or copay.\nLots of us still don\'t know about the most effective birth control methods. The Contraceptive CHOICE Project in St. Louis found that when women learn about the IUD and implant \xe2\x80\x94 methods that are easy-to-use, super-effective, and reversible \xe2\x80\x94 they want in. (Maybe that\'s why 40% of family planning providers use IUDs themselves.) When women in the study learned about the different birth control options and were offered any method they wanted for free, 3 out of 4 chose the IUD or implant. The researchers also found that when more women use IUDs and implants, rates of unplanned pregnancy and abortion go way down.\nDifferent hormonal methods work in different ways. There are lots of different hormonal methods, but they all break down into two categories: combined and progestin-only. Combined hormonal methods like the pill, the patch, and the ring contain both progestin and estrogen. Progestin-only methods like the IUD, the implant, the shot, and the mini-pill contain \xe2\x80\x94 you guessed it \xe2\x80\x94 only progestin. For people with certain health conditions, some hormonal methods are better than others. Knowing the difference between combined and progestin-only methods can also be important for women who\'ve just had a baby or who have high blood pressure, migraines, or a history of stroke or blood clots.\nSometimes it\'s about making the method work for you. Did you know 41% of unplanned pregnancies in the United States (link is external) are to women who were using birth control inconsistently or incorrectly? The IUD and the implant are so effective in part because you don\'t have to use them in any particular way. Once they\'re in place, they just do their thing. Methods like condoms, the pill, or fertility awareness need to be used carefully and consistently or they don\'t work. The good news is that with dedication, practice, and some handy reminders (link is external), you can make whichever method you choose more effective.\nThe side effects aren\'t all bad. We try not to sugarcoat it: Birth control can have negative side effects. If you experience side effects that really affect your quality of life, don\'t settle. Talk to your doctor or nurse about switching to a different method. But many people don\'t realize that many negative side effects fade or go away with time. Some birth control methods even have positive side effects. For instance, some hormonal methods can reduce heavy or painful periods and the risk of ovarian cancer. Condoms can protect against many sexually transmitted infections. Fertility awareness methods can help women understand their bodies\' natural cycles. And the list goes on\xe2\x80\xa6\nFew things are more important to a woman\'s health than being able to decide whether and when to get pregnant. So take a moment this National Women\'s Health Week to make sure the women in your life have the information they need to get on top of their birth control.\nVisit Bedsider (link is external) and the CHOICE Project (link is external) for more information.\nLiz Sabatiuk is Senior Manager of Digital Media at The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, where she develops and manages online content for Bedsider.org. Bedsider seeks to reduce rates of unplanned pregnancy among young adults in the United States by helping them use birth control consistently and effectively.\nRead full blog post\nHealthcare and Women | Menstruation and Menopause | Pregnancy | Reproductive and Sexual Health\nThe statements and opinions in this blog post are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\xc2\xa0Office on Women\'s Health.\nPrevious Page\nNext Page\n104 of 284\nSubscribe\nTo receive Blog email updates\nSubmit\nAbout Us\nWho we are\nWhat we do\nWork with us\nOur vision and mission\nPrograms and Activities\nHealth Information Gateway\nIt\'s Only Natural\nMake the Call, Don\'t Miss a Beat\nNational Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day\nNational Women\'s Health Week\nSupporting Nursing Moms at Work\nPopular Topics\nAutoimmune diseases\nBreastfeeding\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\nDepression\nHIV and AIDS\nMenstruation\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nPregnancy\nThyroid disease\nAll A-Z health topics\nFind Help\nGet breastfeeding help\nGet health care\nGet health insurance\nGet help with family planning\nGet help with mental health\nGet vaccines\nFind girls\' health information\nStay Connected\nBlog\nContact us\nMedia inquiries\nSocial media\nAbout Us\nWho we are\nWhat we do\nWork with us\nOur vision and mission\nPrograms and Activities\nHealth Information Gateway\nIt\'s Only Natural\nMake the Call, Don\'t Miss a Beat\nNational Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day\nNational Women\'s Health Week\nSupporting Nursing Moms at Work\nPopular Topics\nAutoimmune diseases\nBreastfeeding\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\nDepression\nHIV and AIDS\nMenstruation\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nPregnancy\nThyroid disease\nAll A-Z health topics\nFind Help\nGet breastfeeding help\nGet health care\nGet health insurance\nGet help with family planning\nGet help with mental health\nGet vaccines\nFind girls\' health information\nStay Connected\nBlog\nContact us\nMedia inquiries\nSocial media\nSubscribe to receive OWH updates\nSubmit\nHHS Non-Discrimination Notice\nLanguage Assistance Available\nAccessibility\nPrivacy Policy\nDisclaimers\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA)\nUSA.gov\nUse Our Content\nLanguage Assistance Available\nEspa\xc3\xb1ol\n\xe7\xb9\x81\xe9\xab\x94\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87\nTi\xe1\xba\xbfng Vi\xe1\xbb\x87t\n\xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4\nTagalog\n\xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9\n\xd8\xa7\xd9\x84\xd8\xb9\xd8\xb1\xd8\xa8\xd9\x8a\xd8\xa9\nKrey\xc3\xb2l Ayisyen\nFran\xc3\xa7ais\nPolski\nPortugu\xc3\xaas\nItaliano\nDeutsch\n\xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e\n\xd9\x81\xd8\xa7\xd8\xb1\xd8\xb3\xdb\x8c\nEnglish\nA federal government website managed by the Office on Women\'s Health in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human\xc2\xa0Services.\n200 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC\xc2\xa020201\n1-800-994-9662 \xe2\x80\xa2 Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET (closed on federal\xc2\xa0holidays).\nTop'
