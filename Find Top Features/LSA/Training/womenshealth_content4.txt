Your body needs iron to help carry oxygen through your blood to all parts of your body. Iron-deficiency anemia affects more women than men and is more common during pregnancy.\nExpand all\n|\nCollapse all\nWhat is iron-deficiency anemia?\nIron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia, a condition that happens when your body does not make enough healthy red blood cells or the blood cells do not work correctly.\nIron-deficiency anemia happens when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough iron in your body. Your body needs iron to make hemoglobin, the part of the red blood cell that carries oxygen through your blood to all parts of your body.\nWho gets iron-deficiency anemia?\nIron-deficiency anemia affects more women than men. The risk of iron-deficiency anemia is highest for women who:\nAre pregnant. Iron-deficiency anemia affects one in six pregnant women.1 You need more iron during pregnancy to support your unborn baby\xe2\x80\x99s development.\nHave heavy menstrual periods. Up to 5% of women of childbearing age develop iron-deficiency anemia because of heavy bleeding during their periods.2\nInfants, small children, and teens are also at high risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Learn how much iron children need at different ages.\nWhat are the symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia?\nIron-deficiency anemia often develops slowly. In the beginning, you may not have any symptoms, or they may be mild. As it gets worse, you may notice one or more of these symptoms:3\nFatigue (very common)\nWeakness (very common)\nDizziness\nHeadaches\nLow body temperature\nPale or yellow "sallow" skin\nRapid or irregular heartbeat\nShortness of breath or chest pain, especially with physical activity\nBrittle nails\nPica (unusual cravings for ice, very cold drinks, or non-food items like dirt or paper)4\nIf you think you may have iron-deficiency anemia, talk to your doctor or nurse.\nWhat causes iron-deficiency anemia?\nWomen can have low iron levels for several reasons:\nIron lost through bleeding. Bleeding can cause you to lose more blood cells and iron than your body can replace. Women may have low iron levels from bleeding caused by:\nDigestive system problems, such as ulcers, colon polyps, or colon cancer\nRegular, long-term use of aspirin and other over-the-counter pain relievers\nDonating blood too often or without enough time in between donations for your body to recover5\nHeavier or longer than normal menstrual periods\nUterine fibroids, which are noncancerous growths in the uterus that can cause heavy bleeding\nIncreased need for iron during pregnancy. During pregnancy, your body needs more iron than normal to support your developing baby.\nNot eating enough food that contains iron. Your body absorbs the iron in animal-based foods, such as meat, chicken, and fish, two to three times better than the iron in plant-based foods. Vegetarians or vegans, who eat little or no animal-based foods, need to choose other good sources of iron\xc2\xa0to make sure they get enough.6 Your body also absorbs iron from plant-based foods better when you eat them with foods that have vitamin C, such as oranges and tomatoes. But most people in the United States get enough iron from food.\nProblems absorbing iron. Certain health conditions, such as Crohn\'s disease or celiac disease, or gastric bypass surgery for weight loss can make it harder for your body to absorb iron from food.\nHow is iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed?\nTalk to your doctor if you think you might have iron-deficiency anemia. Your doctor may:\nAsk you questions about your health history, including how regular or heavy your menstrual periods are. Your doctor may also ask you about any digestive system problems you may have, such as blood in your stool.\nDo a physical exam\nTalk to you about the foods you eat, the medicines you take, and your family health history\nDo blood tests. Your doctor will do a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood. If the CBC test shows that you have anemia, your doctor will likely do another blood test to measure the iron levels in your blood and confirm that you have iron-deficiency anemia.\nIf you have iron-deficiency anemia, your doctor may want to do other tests to find out what is causing it.\nDo I need to be tested for iron-deficiency anemia?\nMaybe. Talk to your doctor about getting tested as part of your regular health exam if you have heavy menstrual periods or a health problem such as Crohn\'s disease or celiac disease.\nHow is iron-deficiency anemia treated?\nTreatment for iron-deficiency anemia depends on the cause:\nBlood loss from a digestive system problem. If you have an ulcer, your doctor may give you antibiotics or other medicine to treat the ulcer. If your bleeding is caused by a polyp or cancerous tumor, you may need surgery to remove it.\nBlood loss from heavy menstrual periods. Your doctor may give you hormonal birth control to help relieve heavy periods. If your heavy bleeding does not get better, your doctor may recommend surgery. Types of surgery to control heavy bleeding include endometrial ablation, which removes or destroys your uterine lining, and hysterectomy, which removes all or parts of your uterus.\nIncreased need for iron. If you have problems absorbing iron or have lower iron levels but do not have severe anemia, your doctor may recommend:\nIron pills\xc2\xa0to build up your iron levels as quickly as possible. Do not take any iron pills without first talking to your doctor or nurse.\nEating more foods that contain iron.\xc2\xa0Good sources of iron\xc2\xa0include meat, fish, eggs, beans, peas, and fortified foods (look for cereals fortified with 100% of the daily value for iron).\nEating more foods with vitamin C. Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron. Good sources of vitamin C include oranges, broccoli, and tomatoes.\nIf you have severe bleeding or symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath, your doctor may recommend iron or red blood cell transfusions. Transfusions are for severe iron deficiencies only and are much less common.\nWhat do I need to know about iron pills?\nYour doctor may recommend iron pills to help build up your iron levels. Do not take these pills without talking to your doctor or nurse first. Taking iron pills can cause side effects, including an upset stomach, constipation, and diarrhea. If taken as a liquid, iron supplements may stain your teeth.\nYou can reduce side effects from iron pills by taking these steps:\nStart with half of the recommended dose. Gradually increase to the full dose.\nTake iron in divided doses. For example, if you take two pills daily, take one in the morning with breakfast and the other after dinner.\nTake iron with food (especially something with vitamin C, such as a glass of orange juice, to help your body absorb the iron).\nIf one type of iron pill causes side effects, ask your doctor for another type.\nIf you take iron as a liquid instead of as a pill, aim it toward the back of your mouth. This will prevent the liquid from staining your teeth. You can also brush your teeth after taking the medicine to help prevent staining.\nWhat can happen if iron-deficiency anemia is not treated?\nIf left untreated, iron-deficiency anemia can cause serious health problems. Having too little oxygen in the body can damage organs. With anemia, the heart must work harder to make up for the lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin. This extra work can harm the heart.\nIron-deficiency anemia can also cause problems during pregnancy.\nHow can I prevent iron-deficiency anemia?\nYou can help prevent iron-deficiency anemia with the following steps:\nTreat the cause of blood loss. Talk to your doctor if you have heavy menstrual periods or if you have digestive system problems, such as frequent diarrhea or blood in your stool.\nEat foods with iron. Good sources of iron include lean meat and chicken, dark, leafy vegetables, and beans.\nEat and drink foods that help your body absorb iron, like orange juice, strawberries, broccoli, or other fruits and vegetables with vitamin C.\nMake healthy food choices. Most people who make healthy, balanced food choices get the iron and vitamins their bodies need from the foods they eat.\nAvoid drinking coffee or tea with meals. These drinks make it harder for your body to absorb iron.\nTalk to your doctor if you take calcium pills. Calcium can make it harder for your body to absorb iron. If you have a hard time getting enough iron, talk to your doctor about the best way to also get enough calcium.\nHow much iron do I need every day?\nThe chart below lists how much iron you need every day. The recommended amounts are listed in milligrams (mg). See a list of good sources of iron.\nAge\nWomen\nPregnant women\nBreastfeeding women\nVegetarian women*\n14\xe2\x80\x9318 years\n15 mg\n27 mg\n10 mg\n27 mg\n19\xe2\x80\x9350 years\n18 mg\n27 mg\n9 mg\n32 mg\n51+ years\n8 mg\nn/a\nn/a\n14 mg\nSource: Adapted from Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board6\n*Vegetarians need more iron from food than people who eat meat do. This is because the body can absorb iron from meat better than from plant-based foods.\nWhat foods contain iron?\nFood sources of iron include:\nFortified breakfast cereals (18 milligrams per serving)\nOysters (8 milligrams per 3-ounce serving)\nCanned white beans (8 milligrams per cup)\nDark chocolate (7 milligrams per 3-ounce serving)\nBeef liver (5 milligrams per 3-ounce serving)\nSpinach (3 milligrams per \xc2\xbd cup)\nTofu, firm (3 milligrams per \xc2\xbd cup)\nKidney beans (2 milligrams per \xc2\xbd cup)\nCanned tomatoes (2 milligrams per \xc2\xbd cup)\nLean beef (2 milligrams for a 3-ounce serving)\nBaked potato (2 milligrams for a medium potato)\nFind more sources of iron.\nDo I need more iron during pregnancy?\nYes. During pregnancy, your body needs more iron to support your growing baby. In fact, pregnant women need almost twice as much iron as women who are not pregnant do. Not getting enough iron during pregnancy raises your risk for premature birth or a low-birth-weight baby (less than 5 \xc2\xbd pounds). Premature birth is the most common cause of infant death. Both premature birth and low birth weight raise your baby\'s risk for health and developmental problems at birth and during childhood.\nIf you\'re pregnant, talk to your doctor about these steps:\nGetting 27 milligrams of iron every day. Take a prenatal vitamin with iron every day, or talk to your doctor about taking an iron supplement (pill).\nTesting for iron-deficiency anemia7\nTesting for iron-deficiency anemia four to six weeks after childbirth\nDo I need more iron if I am breastfeeding?\nNo, you do not need more iron during breastfeeding. In fact, you need less iron than before you were pregnant. The amount of iron women need during breastfeeding is 10 milligrams per day for young mothers 14 to 18 and 9 milligrams per day for breastfeeding women older than 18.\nYou need less iron while breastfeeding because you likely will not lose a lot through your menstrual cycle. Many breastfeeding women do not have a period or may have only a light period. Also, if you got enough iron during pregnancy (27 milligrams a day), your breastmilk will supply enough iron for your baby.\nDoes menopausal hormone therapy affect how much iron I need to take?\nIt might. If you still get your period and take menopausal hormone therapy, you may need more iron than women who are postmenopausal and do not take menopausal hormone therapy. Talk to your doctor or nurse.\nDoes birth control affect my risk for iron-deficiency anemia?\nIt could. Hormonal birth control, such as the pill, the patch, the shot, or the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD), is often used to treat women with heavy menstrual periods. Lighter menstrual periods may reduce your risk for iron-deficiency anemia.\nAlso, the non-hormonal, copper IUD (Paragard) may make your menstrual flow heavier. This raises your risk for iron-deficiency anemia.\nTalk to your doctor or nurse about your risk for anemia and whether hormonal birth control may help.\nI am a vegetarian. How can I make sure I get enough iron?\nYou can help make sure you get enough iron by choosing foods that contain iron more often. Vegetarians need more iron from food than people who eat meat. This is because the body can absorb iron from meat better than from plant-based foods.\nVegetarian sources of iron include:8\nCereals and bread with added iron\nLentils and beans\nDark chocolate\nDark green leafy vegetables, such as spinach and broccoli\nTofu\nChickpeas\nCanned tomatoes\nTalk to your doctor or nurse about whether you get enough iron. Most people get enough iron from food.\nCan I get more iron than my body needs?\nYes, your body can get too much iron. Extra iron can damage the liver, heart, and pancreas. Try to get no more than 45 milligrams of iron a day, unless your doctor prescribes more.\nSome people get too much iron because of a condition called hemochromatosis that runs in families. Learn more about hemochromatosis, who is at risk, and how it is treated.\nYou can also get too much iron from iron pills (if you also get iron from food) or from repeated blood transfusions.\nDid we answer your question about iron-deficiency anemia?\nFor more information about iron-deficiency anemia, call the OWH Helpline at 1-800-994-9662 or contact the following organizations:\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH, HHS\nPhone Number: 301-592-8573\nAcademy of Nutrition and Dietetics (link is external)\nPhone Number: 800-877-1600\nIron Disorders Institute (link is external)\nPhone Number: 888-565-4766\nSources\nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

During pregnancy, your body needs more iron than normal to support your developing baby.\nNot eating enough food that contains iron. Your body absorbs the iron in animal-based foods, such as meat, chicken, and fish, two to three times better than the iron in plant-based foods. Vegetarians or vegans, who eat little or no animal-based foods, need to choose other good sources of iron\xc2\xa0to make sure they get enough.6 Your body also absorbs iron from plant-based foods better when you eat them with foods that have vitamin C, such as oranges and tomatoes. But most people in the United States get enough iron from food.\nProblems absorbing iron. Certain health conditions, such as Crohn\'s disease or celiac disease, or gastric bypass surgery for weight loss can make it harder for your body to absorb iron from food.\nHow is iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed?\nTalk to your doctor if you think you might have iron-deficiency anemia. Your doctor may:\nAsk you questions about your health history, including how regular or heavy your menstrual periods are. Your doctor may also ask you about any digestive system problems you may have, such as blood in your stool.\nDo a physical exam\nTalk to you about the foods you eat, the medicines you take, and your family health history\nDo blood tests. Your doctor will do a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood. If the CBC test shows that you have anemia, your doctor will likely do another blood test to measure the iron levels in your blood and confirm that you have iron-deficiency anemia.\nIf you have iron-deficiency anemia, your doctor may want to do other tests to find out what is causing it.\nDo I need to be tested for iron-deficiency anemia?\nMaybe. Talk to your doctor about getting tested as part of your regular health exam if you have heavy menstrual periods or a health problem such as Crohn\'s disease or celiac disease.\nHow is iron-deficiency anemia treated?\nTreatment for iron-deficiency anemia depends on the cause:\nBlood loss from a digestive system problem. If you have an ulcer, your doctor may give you antibiotics or other medicine to treat the ulcer. If your bleeding is caused by a polyp or cancerous tumor, you may need surgery to remove it.\nBlood loss from heavy menstrual periods. Your doctor may give you hormonal birth control to help relieve heavy periods. If your heavy bleeding does not get better, your doctor may recommend surgery. Types of surgery to control heavy bleeding include endometrial ablation, which removes or destroys your uterine lining, and hysterectomy, which removes all or parts of your uterus.\nIncreased need for iron. If you have problems absorbing iron or have lower iron levels but do not have severe anemia, your doctor may recommend:\nIron pills\xc2\xa0to build up your iron levels as quickly as possible. Do not take any iron pills without first talking to your doctor or nurse.\nEating more foods that contain iron.\xc2\xa0Good sources of iron\xc2\xa0include meat, fish, eggs, beans, peas, and fortified foods (look for cereals fortified with 100% of the daily value for iron).\nEating more foods with vitamin C. Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron. Good sources of vitamin C include oranges, broccoli, and tomatoes.\nIf you have severe bleeding or symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath, your doctor may recommend iron or red blood cell transfusions. Transfusions are for severe iron deficiencies only and are much less common.\nWhat do I need to know about iron pills?\nYour doctor may recommend iron pills to help build up your iron levels. Do not take these pills without talking to your doctor or nurse first. Taking iron pills can cause side effects, including an upset stomach, constipation, and diarrhea. If taken as a liquid, iron supplements may stain your teeth.\nYou can reduce side effects from iron pills by taking these steps:\nStart with half of the recommended dose. Gradually increase to the full dose.\nTake iron in divided doses. For example, if you take two pills daily, take one in the morning with breakfast and the other after dinner.\nTake iron with food (especially something with vitamin C, such as a glass of orange juice, to help your body absorb the iron).\nIf one type of iron pill causes side effects, ask your doctor for another type.\nIf you take iron as a liquid instead of as a pill, aim it toward the back of your mouth. This will prevent the liquid from staining your teeth. You can also brush your teeth after taking the medicine to help prevent staining.\nWhat can happen if iron-deficiency anemia is not treated?\nIf left untreated, iron-deficiency anemia can cause serious health problems. Having too little oxygen in the body can damage organs. With anemia, the heart must work harder to make up for the lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin. This extra work can harm the heart.\nIron-deficiency anemia can also cause problems during pregnancy.\nHow can I prevent iron-deficiency anemia?\nYou can help prevent iron-deficiency anemia with the following steps:\nTreat the cause of blood loss. Talk to your doctor if you have heavy menstrual periods or if you have digestive system problems, such as frequent diarrhea or blood in your stool.\nEat foods with iron. Good sources of iron include lean meat and chicken, dark, leafy vegetables, and beans.\nEat and drink foods that help your body absorb iron, like orange juice, strawberries, broccoli, or other fruits and vegetables with vitamin C.\nMake healthy food choices. Most people who make healthy, balanced food choices get the iron and vitamins their bodies need from the foods they eat.\nAvoid drinking coffee or tea with meals. These drinks make it harder for your body to absorb iron.\nTalk to your doctor if you take calcium pills. Calcium can make it harder for your body to absorb iron. If you have a hard time getting enough iron, talk to your doctor about the best way to also get enough calcium.\nHow much iron do I need every day?\nThe chart below lists how much iron you need every day. The recommended amounts are listed in milligrams (mg). See a list of good sources of iron.\nAge\nWomen\nPregnant women\nBreastfeeding women\nVegetarian women*\n14\xe2\x80\x9318 years\n15 mg\n27 mg\n10 mg\n27 mg\n19\xe2\x80\x9350 years\n18 mg\n27 mg\n9 mg\n32 mg\n51+ years\n8 mg\nn/a\nn/a\n14 mg\nSource: Adapted from Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board6\n*Vegetarians need more iron from food than people who eat meat do. This is because the body can absorb iron from meat better than from plant-based foods.\nWhat foods contain iron?\nFood sources of iron include:\nFortified breakfast cereals (18 milligrams per serving)\nOysters (8 milligrams per 3-ounce serving)\nCanned white beans (8 milligrams per cup)\nDark chocolate (7 milligrams per 3-ounce serving)\nBeef liver (5 milligrams per 3-ounce serving)\nSpinach (3 milligrams per \xc2\xbd cup)\nTofu, firm (3 milligrams per \xc2\xbd cup)\nKidney beans (2 milligrams per \xc2\xbd cup)\nCanned tomatoes (2 milligrams per \xc2\xbd cup)\nLean beef (2 milligrams for a 3-ounce serving)\nBaked potato (2 milligrams for a medium potato)\nFind more sources of iron.\nDo I need more iron during pregnancy?\nYes. During pregnancy, your body needs more iron to support your growing baby. In fact, pregnant women need almost twice as much iron as women who are not pregnant do. Not getting enough iron during pregnancy raises your risk for premature birth or a low-birth-weight baby (less than 5 \xc2\xbd pounds). Premature birth is the most common cause of infant death. Both premature birth and low birth weight raise your baby\'s risk for health and developmental problems at birth and during childhood.\nIf you\'re pregnant, talk to your doctor about these steps:\nGetting 27 milligrams of iron every day. Take a prenatal vitamin with iron every day, or talk to your doctor about taking an iron supplement (pill).\nTesting for iron-deficiency anemia7\nTesting for iron-deficiency anemia four to six weeks after childbirth\nDo I need more iron if I am breastfeeding?\nNo, you do not need more iron during breastfeeding. In fact, you need less iron than before you were pregnant. The amount of iron women need during breastfeeding is 10 milligrams per day for young mothers 14 to 18 and 9 milligrams per day for breastfeeding women older than 18.\nYou need less iron while breastfeeding because you likely will not lose a lot through your menstrual cycle. Many breastfeeding women do not have a period or may have only a light period. Also, if you got enough iron during pregnancy (27 milligrams a day), your breastmilk will supply enough iron for your baby.\nDoes menopausal hormone therapy affect how much iron I need to take?\nIt might. If you still get your period and take menopausal hormone therapy, you may need more iron than women who are postmenopausal and do not take menopausal hormone therapy. Talk to your doctor or nurse.\nDoes birth control affect my risk for iron-deficiency anemia?\nIt could. Hormonal birth control, such as the pill, the patch, the shot, or the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD), is often used to treat women with heavy menstrual periods. Lighter menstrual periods may reduce your risk for iron-deficiency anemia.\nAlso, the non-hormonal, copper IUD (Paragard) may make your menstrual flow heavier. This raises your risk for iron-deficiency anemia.\nTalk to your doctor or nurse about your risk for anemia and whether hormonal birth control may help.\nI am a vegetarian. How can I make sure I get enough iron?\nYou can help make sure you get enough iron by choosing foods that contain iron more often. Vegetarians need more iron from food than people who eat meat. This is because the body can absorb iron from meat better than from plant-based foods.\nVegetarian sources of iron include:8\nCereals and bread with added iron\nLentils and beans\nDark chocolate\nDark green leafy vegetables, such as spinach and broccoli\nTofu\nChickpeas\nCanned tomatoes\nTalk to your doctor or nurse about whether you get enough iron. Most people get enough iron from food.\nCan I get more iron than my body needs?\nYes, your body can get too much iron. Extra iron can damage the liver, heart, and pancreas. Try to get no more than 45 milligrams of iron a day, unless your doctor prescribes more.\nSome people get too much iron because of a condition called hemochromatosis that runs in families. Learn more about hemochromatosis, who is at risk, and how it is treated.\nYou can also get too much iron from iron pills (if you also get iron from food) or from repeated blood transfusions.\nDid we answer your question about iron-deficiency anemia?\nFor more information about iron-deficiency anemia, call the OWH Helpline at 1-800-994-9662 or contact the following organizations:\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH, HHS\nPhone Number: 301-592-8573\nAcademy of Nutrition and Dietetics (link is external)\nPhone Number: 800-877-1600\nIron Disorders Institute (link is external)\nPhone Number: 888-565-4766\nSources\nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force.
