IUDs are VERY effective.
IUDs give you great, long-term protection against pregnancy — they’re more than 99% effective. They work as well as sterilization and the birth control implant. IUDs are one of the most effective methods you can get because there’s almost no way you can mess it up. You can’t forget to use it (like the pill or ring), or use it incorrectly (like condoms). IUDs are “set-it-and-forget-it” birth control.
IUDs are REALLY convenient.
Once your IUD is in, you barely have to think about it — it works until it expires or you have it taken out. That means no trips to the pharmacy, no pill to take or ring to put in, and nothing you have to do before sex to prevent pregnancy. Plus you’re protected against pregnancy for 3 to 12 years, depending on what kind you get.
You can get pregnant after taking out an IUD.
IUDs are reversible. If you decide you want to get pregnant, you can get it removed at any time. IUDs won’t affect your fertility or make it harder to get pregnant in the future. In fact, it’s possible to get pregnant as soon as your IUD is out.
IUDs can make your periods better.
Hormonal IUDs (Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla) can cut down on cramps and make your period way lighter. Some people totally stop getting periods at all. Hormonal IUDs can help treat people who suffer from severe cramps, really heavy periods, and anemia.
The copper IUD doesn’t have hormones.
Some people prefer non-hormonal birth control, or can’t use methods with hormones because of medical problems. Luckily, the Paragard (copper) IUD is super effective at preventing pregnancy AND totally hormone free.
The copper IUD can be used as emergency contraception.
Paragard IUDs are the most effective form of emergency contraception out there. If you get one within 120 hours (5 days) of having unprotected sex, it’s over 99% effective against pregnancy. And — bonus! — your copper IUD can keep preventing pregnancy for as long as you like up to 12 years.
