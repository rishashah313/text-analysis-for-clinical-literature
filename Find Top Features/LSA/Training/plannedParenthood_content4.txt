How much does an IUD cost?
Getting an IUD costs anywhere between $0 to $1,300. That’s a pretty wide range, but the good news is that IUDs can be free or low cost with many health insurance plans, Medicaid, and some other government programs.
Prices can also vary depending on which kind you get. The price of an IUD includes medical exams, getting the IUD put in, and follow-up visits.
Even if an IUD costs more than other methods up front, they usually end up saving you money in the long run because they last for years.
If you’re worried about cost, check with your local Planned Parenthood health center to see if they can hook you up with birth control that fits your budget.
Can I get an IUD for free or low-cost?
There's a good chance you can get an IUD for free (or for a reduced price) if you have health insurance. Because of the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), most insurance plans must cover all methods of birth control, including IUDs.
However, some plans don’t cover all brands of IUDs. Your health insurance provider can tell you which ones they pay for. Your doctor may also be able to help you get your birth control method of choice covered by health insurance. Learn more about health insurance and affordable birth control.
If you don't have health insurance, you've still got options. Depending on your income and legal status in the U.S., you may qualify for Medicaid or other state programs that can help you pay for birth control and other health care.
Planned Parenthood works to provide you with the services you need, whether or not you have insurance. Most Planned Parenthood health centers accept Medicaid and health insurance, and many charge less for services and birth control depending on your income. Contact your local Planned Parenthood health center for more information.
Where do I go to get an IUD?
An IUD has to be put in by a doctor, nurse, or other health care provider. You can contact your gynecologist, family planning clinics, or a local Planned Parenthood health center to find out more about getting an IUD.
