BV is common, and any woman can get it. BV is easily treatable with medicine from your doctor or nurse. If left untreated, it can raise your risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and cause problems during pregnancy.\nExpand all\n|\nCollapse all\nWhat is bacterial vaginosis (BV)?\nBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a condition caused by changes in the amount of certain types of bacteria in your vagina. BV can develop when your vagina has more harmful bacteria than good bacteria.\nWho gets BV?\nBV is the most common vaginal condition in women ages 15 to 44.1\xc2\xa0But women of any age can get it, even if they have never had sex.\nYou may be more at risk for BV if you:\nHave a new sex partner\nHave multiple sex partners\nDouche2\nDo not use condoms or\xc2\xa0dental dams\nAre pregnant. BV is common during\xc2\xa0pregnancy. About 1 in 4 pregnant women get BV.3\xc2\xa0The risk for BV is higher for pregnant women because of the hormonal changes that happen during pregnancy.\nAre African-American. BV is twice as common in African-American women as in white women.4\nHave an intrauterine device (IUD), especially if you also have irregular bleeding5\nHow do you get BV?\nResearchers are still studying how women get BV. You can get BV without having sex, but BV is more common in women who are sexually active. Having a new sex partner or multiple sex partners, as well as douching, can upset the balance of good and harmful bacteria in your vagina. This raises your risk of getting BV.1\nWhat are the symptoms of BV?\nMany women have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may include:\nUnusual vaginal discharge. The discharge can be white (milky) or gray. It may also be foamy or watery. Some women report a strong fish-like odor, especially after sex.\nBurning when urinating\nItching around the outside of the vagina\nVaginal irritation\nThese symptoms may be similar to\xc2\xa0vaginal yeast infections\xc2\xa0and other health problems. Only your doctor or nurse can tell you for sure whether you have BV.\nWhat is the difference between BV and a vaginal yeast infection?\nBV and\xc2\xa0vaginal yeast infections\xc2\xa0are both common causes of vaginal discharge. They have similar symptoms, so it can be hard to know if you have BV or a yeast infection. Only your doctor or nurse can tell you for sure if you have BV.\nWith BV, your discharge may be white or gray but may also have a fishy smell. Discharge from a yeast infection may also be white or gray but may look like cottage cheese.\nHow is BV diagnosed?\nThere are tests to find out if you have BV. Your doctor or nurse takes a sample of vaginal discharge. Your doctor or nurse may then look at the sample under a microscope, use an in-office test, or send it to a lab to check for harmful bacteria. Your doctor or nurse may also see signs of BV during an exam.\nBefore you see a doctor or nurse for a test:\nDon\'t\xc2\xa0douche\xc2\xa0or use vaginal deodorant sprays. They might cover odors that can help your doctor diagnose BV. They can also irritate your vagina.\nMake an appointment for a day when you do not have your period.\nHow is BV treated?\nBV is treated with\xc2\xa0antibiotics\xc2\xa0prescribed by your doctor.\nIf you get BV, your male sex partner won\'t need to be treated. But, if you are female and have a female sex partner, she might also have BV. If your current partner is female, she needs to see her doctor. She may also need treatment.\nIt is also possible to get BV again. Learn how to\xc2\xa0lower your risk for BV.\nBV and vaginal yeast infections are treated differently. BV is treated with antibiotics prescribed by your doctor. Yeast infections can be treated with over-the-counter medicines. But you cannot treat BV with over-the-counter yeast infection medicine.\nWhat can happen if BV is not treated?\nIf BV is untreated, possible problems may include:6\nHigher risk of getting STIs, including HIV.\xc2\xa0Having BV can raise your risk of getting\xc2\xa0HIV,\xc2\xa0genital herpes,\xc2\xa0chlamydia,\xc2\xa0pelvic inflammatory disease, and\xc2\xa0gonorrhea. Women with HIV who get BV are also more likely to pass HIV to a male sexual partner.\nPregnancy problems.\xc2\xa0BV can lead to premature birth or a low-birth-weight baby (smaller than 5 1/2 pounds at birth). All pregnant women with symptoms of BV should be tested and treated if they have it.\nWhat should I do if I have BV?\nBV is easy to treat. If you think you have BV:\nSee a doctor or nurse.\xc2\xa0Antibiotics\xc2\xa0will treat BV.\nTake all of your medicine. Even if symptoms go away, you need to finish\xc2\xa0all\xc2\xa0of the antibiotic.\nTell your sex partner(s) if she is female\xc2\xa0so she can be treated.\nAvoid sexual contact until you finish your treatment.\nSee your doctor or nurse again if you have symptoms that don\'t go away\xc2\xa0within a few days after finishing the antibiotic.\nIs it safe to treat pregnant women who have BV?\nYes. The medicine used to treat BV is safe for pregnant women. All pregnant women with symptoms of BV should be tested and treated if they have it.\nIf you do have BV, you can be treated safely at any stage of your pregnancy. You will get the same antibiotic given to women who are not pregnant.\nHow can I lower my risk of BV?\nResearchers do not know exactly how BV spreads. Steps that might lower your risk of BV include:\nKeeping your vaginal bacteria balanced. Use warm water only to clean the outside of your vagina. You do not need to use soap. Even mild soap can cause irritate your vagina. Always wipe front to back from your vagina to your\xc2\xa0anus. Keep the area cool by wearing cotton or cotton-lined underpants.\nNot douching. Douching upsets the balance of good and harmful bacteria in your vagina. This may raise your risk of BV. It may also make it easier to get BV again after treatment. Doctors do not recommend douching.\nNot having sex. Researchers are still studying how women get BV. You can get BV without having sex, but BV is more common in women who have sex.\nLimiting your number of sex partners. Researchers think that your risk of getting BV goes up with the number of partners you have.\nHow can I protect myself if I am a female and my female partner has BV?\nIf your partner has BV, you might be able to lower your risk by using protection during sex.\nUse a\xc2\xa0dental dam\xc2\xa0every time you have sex. A dental dam is a thin piece of latex that is placed over the vagina before oral sex.\nCover sex toys with condoms before use. Remove the condom and replace it with a new one before sharing the toy with your partner.\nDid we answer your question about BV?\nFor more information about bacterial vaginosis, call the OWH Helpline at 1-800-994-9662, or contact the following organizations:\nNational Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP), CDC, HHS\nPhone Number: 800-232-4636\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (link is external)\nPhone Number: 202-638-5577\nAmerican Sexual Health Association (link is external)\nPhone Number: 919-361-8400\nSources\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.
