Fortunately, medical providers and researchers, with the help of the media, are making major progress in spreading the word that new models of the IUD are safe, low-maintenance, super-effective, and can be used by most people with a uterus.\nIn spite of all the good news about IUDs, there are still lots of myths and misunderstandings about it rattling around the internet and even among health care providers. Here are 5 of the most common myths I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard\xe2\x80\x94and the reality behind each.\nMyth 1: The IUD is dangerous\xe2\x80\x94it can cause infections and infertility.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has conducted study after study with thousands of women around the world, and all the evidence disproves this myth. The data are totally conclusive: overall, women using an IUD have no increased risk of pelvic infection or infertility compared with women who used other types of birth control (with the exception of condoms, which protect from sexually transmitted infections, a.k.a. STIs). If a health care provider tries to tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s not safe for you to use an IUD, get a second opinion.\nOn a side note, the WHO studies did discover a factor that is related to infertility: Chlamydia, a common and often silent STI. So get tested before starting a new relationship, and make sure your partner gets tested, too! It\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as peeing in a cup or getting a quick swab. If\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not in a monogamous relationship\xe2\x80\x94no matter what kind of birth control you use\xe2\x80\x94you should always use a condom to prevent STIs.\nMyth 2: The IUD is a big commitment\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s best for women who are older, married, or already have kids.\nOne of the best things about the IUD is how long it can last\xe2\x80\x94between 3 and 6 years for the hormonal options (Mirena, Skyla, LILETTA, and Kyleena) and up to 12 years for the non-hormonal IUD (ParaGard). But there\xe2\x80\x99s no minimum requirement for how long it has to stay in\xe2\x80\x94you can have an IUD removed at any time on request. Generally it\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as a trip to the clinic, a gentle pull on the strings, and voil\xc3\xa0! The IUD is out.\nIf you have an IUD removed, remember that the contraceptive effect wears off immediately. If you\xe2\x80\x99re sexually active and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get pregnant, start another method pronto. Depending on what method you switch to, you may even want to start using it before having the IUD removed.\nSome out-of-date providers won\xe2\x80\x99t insert IUDs for teens or people who haven\xe2\x80\x99t had kids\xe2\x80\x94fortunately, many are catching up with the times. A number of the concerns about IUDs for young women are related to Myth 1. Providers may worry that younger people have higher rates of STIs, which, if untreated, can lead to infertility\xe2\x80\x94but as I noted above, research has shown these fears to be totally baseless when it comes to the IUD models on the U.S. market today.\nMyth 3: Getting an IUD is all pain, no gain.\nPain is subjective and IUD insertion pain varies a lot from person to person. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know how you will respond ahead of time, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re worried about pain, talk with your provider.\nWhile there are some things that can help make the insertion process more comfortable, unfortunately, there is no magic pill to make it totally painless for everyone. Our bodies are wired differently. Some people, especially if they\xe2\x80\x99ve had a baby, find IUD insertion no more uncomfortable than a pap smear. Others, especially if they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been pregnant or have a history of very painful periods, can have very strong cramps during the insertion and the period following it.\nFor a while, some health care providers were giving women a pill called Cytotec or misoprostol before IUD insertion to help with pain. Recent research has confirmed that misoprostol does not help and may actually make you more uncomfortable because of side effects like nausea and low fever.\nSome people recommend taking a pain killer like ibuprofen before insertion.\nUnfortunately, research hasn\xe2\x80\x99t found this to affect insertion pain, though there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in trying.\nSome providers may offer a \xe2\x80\x9ccervical block,\xe2\x80\x9d which is local anesthesia injected at the cervix. There is mixed evidence on whether this helps\xe2\x80\xa6 and the injections themselves can be uncomfortable.\nPart of what can make an IUD insertion uncomfortable is opening the cervix when it is closed\xe2\x80\x94it can feel a lot like a strong menstrual cramp.\n(No coincidence, since menstrual cramps are caused partly by the process of the cervix opening.) So here\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that does help: schedule the IUD insertion when your cervix is naturally a little open. This happens twice during each menstrual cycle\xe2\x80\x94during your period and during ovulation. Of course, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to schedule insertion at one of these times, but it may reduce discomfort.\nAs for discomfort after insertion, it should be minimal by the time you head home. If you have cramping over the next few days, ibuprofen and a heating pad can make a difference. If you still have pain after a few weeks, or the pain is severe, check in with your provider.\nMyth 4: You need to get a Pap smear before getting an IUD.\nPap smears are unrelated to birth control, including IUDs. If you\xe2\x80\x99re due for a Pap smear, it may be convenient to do it at the same time as an IUD insertion, but if everything looks normal, there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to get the results back first. Even if you\xe2\x80\x99ve had an abnormal Pap result in the past, you can use an IUD.\nMyth 5: Your partner will be able to feel the IUD poking him.\nThe IUD is placed inside the uterus, at the very top (called the fundus), so it should be out of the way where no partner should ever run into it! Plastic strings are attached to the end, which run through the cervix and outside into the vagina. The strings should be left long enough to be tucked up behind the cervix. The average vagina is about 6 inches long, and the cervix is at the very top of the vagina. The strings are soft enough that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bother you or your partner, though some people say they can feel them during sex.\nIf you or your partner are experiencing discomfort when you have sex, go to your health care provider to make sure the IUD is placed properly and not partially sticking out of your uterus (a.k.a. expelling). It is also possible that the IUD\xe2\x80\x99s thin, flexible strings are in an awkward position and just need to be adjusted.\nThe IUD is the Mercedes-Benz of modern contraception\xe2\x80\x94its safety, efficacy, and other benefits are amazing. If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a highly effective, no muss, no fuss contraceptive, look no further.
