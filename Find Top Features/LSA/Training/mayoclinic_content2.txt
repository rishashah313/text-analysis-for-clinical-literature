Mirena prevents pregnancy for up to five years.\nMirena is a hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) that can provide long-term birth control (contraception).\nThe device is a T-shaped plastic frame that\'s inserted into the uterus, where it releases a type of the hormone progestin. To prevent pregnancy, Mirena:\nThickens mucus in the cervix to stop sperm from reaching or fertilizing an egg\nThins the lining of the uterus and partially suppresses ovulation\nMirena prevents pregnancy for up to five years after insertion. It\'s one of several hormonal IUDs with Food and Drug Administration approval.\nWhy it\'s doneMirena offers effective, long-term contraception. It can be used in premenopausal women of all ages, including teenagers.\nAmong various benefits, Mirena:\nEliminates the need to interrupt sex for contraception\nDoesn\'t require partner participation\nCan remain in place for up to five years\nCan be removed at any time, followed by a quick return to your normal fertility\nCan be used while breast-feeding \xe2\x80\x94 although your health care provider will likely recommend waiting six to eight weeks after childbirth because earlier placement increases the risk of injuring the uterus during placement\nDoesn\'t carry the risk of side effects related to birth control methods containing estrogen\nMirena can decrease menstrual bleeding after three or more months of use. About 20 percent of women stop having periods after one year of using Mirena.\nMirena can also decrease:\nSevere menstrual pain and pain related to the abnormal growth of uterine-lining tissue outside the uterus (endometriosis)\nThe risk of pelvic infection\nThe risk of endometrial cancer\nBecause of these noncontraceptive benefits, Mirena is often prescribed for women with:\nHeavy menstrual bleeding\nCramping or pain with periods\nEndometriosis\nAbnormal growth of the lining of the uterus (endometrial hyperplasia)\nAbnormal growth of uterine-lining tissue into the muscular wall of the uterus (adenomyosis)\nAnemia\nFibroids\nMirena isn\'t appropriate for everyone. Your health care provider may discourage use of Mirena if you have:\nBreast cancer, or have had it\nUterine or cervical cancer\nLiver disease\nUterine abnormalities, such as fibroids, that interfere with the placement or retention of Mirena\nA pelvic infection or current pelvic inflammatory disease\nUnexplained vaginal bleeding\nTell your health care provider if you:\nTake any medications, including nonprescription and herbal products\nHave diabetes or high blood pressure\nHave a heart condition or have had a heart attack\nHave migraines\nHave blood-clotting problems or have had a stroke\nRecently gave birth or are breast-feeding\nRisksLess than 1 percent of women who use Mirena will get pregnant in a year of typical use.\nIf you do conceive while using Mirena, you\'re at higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy \xe2\x80\x94 when the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. However, because Mirena prevents most pregnancies, women who use it are at lower risk of having an ectopic pregnancy than are other sexually active women who are not using contraception.\nMirena is generally safe. But it\'s important to remember that:\nMirena doesn\'t protect against STIs.\nRarely, insertion of Mirena causes perforation of the uterus. The risk of perforation might be higher when inserted during the postpartum period.\nSide effects associated with Mirena include:\nHeadache\nAcne\nBreast tenderness\nIrregular bleeding, which can improve after six months of use\nMood changes\nCramping or pelvic pain\nIt\'s also possible to expel Mirena from your uterus. You may be more likely to expel Mirena if you:\nHave never been pregnant\nHave heavy or prolonged periods\nHave severe menstrual pain\nPreviously expelled an IUD\nAre younger than age 20\nHad Mirena inserted immediately after childbirth\nYour health care provider may recommend removal of Mirena if you develop:\nA pelvic infection\nInflammation of the endometrium (endometritis)\nEndometrial or cervical cancer\nPelvic pain or pain during sex\nVery severe migraine\nA significant increase in blood pressure, or have a stroke or heart attack\nPossible exposure to an STI\nHow you prepareYour health care provider will evaluate your overall health and do a pelvic exam before inserting Mirena. You may be screened for STIs.\nMirena can be inserted:\nAnytime during your menstrual cycle if you\'re not pregnant. You might need to take a pregnancy test to confirm you\'re not pregnant.\nImmediately after a pregnancy termination.\nImmediately after delivering a baby vaginally or by cesarean section \xe2\x80\x94 although insertion immediately after vaginal delivery increases the risk of expelling Mirena.\nIf you have Mirena inserted more than seven days after the start of your period, be sure to use backup contraception for one week.\nTaking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), one to two hours before the procedure can help reduce cramping.\nWhat you can expect\nMirena placementMirena placementMirena is a hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) that\'s inserted into the uterus by a health care provider. Mirena prevents pregnancy for up to five years.\nMirena is typically inserted in a health care provider\'s office.\nDuring the procedureYour health care provider will insert a speculum into your vagina and clean your vagina and cervix with an antiseptic solution. Special instruments might be used to gently align your cervical canal and uterine cavity and to measure the depth of your uterine cavity.\nNext, your health care provider will fold Mirena\'s horizontal arms and place the device inside an applicator tube. The tube is inserted into your cervical canal, and Mirena is carefully placed in your uterus. When the applicator tube is removed, Mirena will remain in place.\nYour health care provider will trim Mirena\'s strings so that they don\'t protrude too far into the vagina, and may record the length of the strings.\nDuring Mirena insertion, you may experience cramping, dizziness, fainting or a slower than normal heart rate.\nAfter the procedureOnce a month, check to feel that Mirena\'s strings are protruding from your cervix. Be careful not to pull on the strings.\nAbout a month after Mirena is inserted, your health care provider may re-examine you to make sure Mirena hasn\'t moved and to check for signs and symptoms of infection.\nWhile you\'re using Mirena, contact your health care provider immediately if you:\nThink you may be pregnant\nHave unusually heavy, persistent vaginal bleeding\nHave abdominal pain or pain during sex\nHave an unexplained fever\nHave unusual or foul-smelling vaginal discharge, lesions or sores\nDevelop very severe headaches or migraines\nHave yellowing of the skin or eyes\nWere exposed to an STI\nCan no longer feel the IUD strings, or they suddenly seem longer\nIt\'s also important to contact your health care provider immediately if you think Mirena is no longer in place. Your provider will check the location of Mirena and, if it\'s displaced, remove it if necessary.\nRemovalMirena can remain in place for up to five years. To remove Mirena, your health care provider will likely use forceps to grasp the device\'s strings and gently pull. The device\'s arms will fold upward as it\'s withdrawn from the uterus.\nLight bleeding and cramping is common during removal. Rarely, removal can be more complicated.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nRequest an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\nSept. 05, 2019\nPrint\nShare on: FacebookTwitter\nShow references\nHatcher RA, et al.
