Knowing she needed something more reliable, she decided on a Mirena IUD.\nAt first Kat was worried about the cost of her IUD, but she talked to her provider and found out it was covered by her insurance. In hindsight, she would pay \xe2\x80\x9cpretty much anything\xe2\x80\x9d for this method that removes the worry because it\xe2\x80\x99s always \xe2\x80\x9cjust there.\xe2\x80\x9d\nupdated\n05/27/2015\nI just needed something low\nmaintenance.\nread more about:\nvideo, IUD, real story\nread our commenting policy \xc2\xbb\nA NOTE ABOUT COMMENTING /\nWe trust that sexy brain of yours to post with good intentions.
