It can help prevent pregnancy if used within 5 days of having sex. You might use emergency contraception if:\nYou had unprotected sex.\nYou had unprotected sex and forgot to take your birth control pills.\nYour partner\xe2\x80\x99s condom broke or slipped off during sex.\nYour diaphragm or sponge came out of place during sex.\nYou were raped.\nThere are 2 types of emergency contraception available. One option is medicine, which is often known as \xe2\x80\x9cthe morning-after pill.\xe2\x80\x9d In the United States, pills that contain levonorgestrel do not require a prescription from your doctor. You can purchase them over the counter at a pharmacy. Pills that contain ulipristal acetate do require a prescription. The second option is to use an IUD that contains copper (ParaGard). You must go to a doctor to have an IUD inserted.\nEmergency contraceptive pills can be very effective if they are used in time. The sooner you take them after sex, the more effective they are. Ulipristal acetate pills reduce your risk of pregnancy more than levonorgestrel pills. They cannot prevent pregnancy if you have unprotected sex after taking them.\nParaGard, an IUD, is a small, T-shaped device that is placed inside your uterus. Unlike pills, IUDs don\xe2\x80\x99t stop your ovaries from releasing an egg. They can prevent an egg from being fertilized or implanted. An IUD is very effective for emergency contraception. It can reduce your risk of pregnancy by more than 99%. This is if your doctor inserts it within 5 days of sex. This IUD can be left in your body for up to 10 years to prevent pregnancy. Some women use IUDs as their regular form of birth control. Common side effects of a ParaGard IUD are heavier, longer periods and spotting or cramping between periods. Symptoms usually improve in the first 3 to 6 months.\nPlaces to get emergency contraception include:\nyour primary care doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office\ncollege/university and women\xe2\x80\x99s health centers\npublic health departments\nhospital emergency departments\nPlanned Parenthood centers.\nPath to improved health\nEmergency contraception can prevent pregnancy by:\nstopping ovulation (the release of an egg from your ovaries)\nstopping sperm from fertilizing an egg\nstopping a fertilized egg from implantation (attaching itself to the wall of your uterus).\nEmergency contraception cannot prevent or end pregnancy if a fertilized egg already is implanted. Because of this, emergency contraception is not a means of abortion.\nMost medicine brands require a single dose of 1 pill. Some brands have 2 doses (1 pill followed by a second pill 12 hours later). Sometimes, you can take both pills together. Follow the instructions for each specific brand. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that some brands of regular birth control pills can be used in increased doses for emergency contraception. However, this method is less effective. It can cause more side effects. Talk to your doctor to see if your birth control pills are safe for emergency use.\nSome women feel nauseous after they take emergency contraceptive pills. This feeling should go away in about 2 days. Your doctor can give you medicine to reduce nausea. Other possible side effects include headache, cramping, and tender breasts.\nThings to consider\nKeep in mind, emergency contraception does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). You should not use any emergency contraception if you know you are pregnant or are trying to get pregnant.\nWomen who are breastfeeding should not use pills that contain ulipristal acetate. Pills also are less effective for women who are overweight or obese. Instead, these women should use the ParaGard IUD. Do not get an IUD if you:\nhave abnormal bleeding\nhave cancer of the cervix or uterus\nhave the AIDS infection\nare allergic to copper.\nEmergency contraceptive pills can affect your menstrual cycle. Talk to your doctor if you do not get your period within 1 month after taking them. Your doctor also can tell you when to start taking your regular form of birth control again. It will vary if you use a hormonal form, such as pills, shots, the patch, or a vaginal ring. If you use a barrier method, such as a diaphragm or condoms, you can start using it right away. If you do not use birth control, talk to your doctor about which method will work best for you.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nWhich type of emergency contraceptive pills should I use?\nWhat happens if I take extra regular birth control pills in an emergency?\nHow soon after unprotected sex should I take a pregnancy test?\nResources\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services: Office on Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health, Emergency Contraception\nLast Updated: May 10, 2017\nThis article was contributed by familydoctor.org editorial staff.\nCategories: Birth Control, Prevention and Wellness, Sex and Birth ControlTags: female, gynecologic, Insertion/removal of intrauterine device (IUD) October 1, 2004\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.
