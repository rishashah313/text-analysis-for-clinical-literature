Resources\nAdvertisement\nWhat is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)?\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an\xc2\xa0infection\xc2\xa0of the female reproductive organs. This includes the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. It is often caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. Other infections that are not STIs can also cause PID.\nLeft untreated, PID can damage a woman\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive organs. It can cause trouble getting pregnant, problems during pregnancy, and long-term pelvic pain.\nSymptoms\nPID causes different symptoms in different women. These may include:\nA dull pain and tenderness in the lower abdomen.\nVaginal discharge that is yellow or green and may have an unpleasant smell.\nIrregular menstrual periods, such as extra-long periods, spotting, or cramps throughout the month.\nChills, fever, nausea,\xc2\xa0diarrhea,\xc2\xa0and vomiting.\nPain during sex.\nLow back pain.\nPainful urination.\nSome women who have PID do not experience these symptoms and do not know they have it.\nIf you have the above symptoms, or if you think you have been exposed to an STI, call your doctor. The sooner you see your doctor, the better. Waiting can allow the infection to spread and cause more pain and damage.\nCauses\nWhat causes PID?\nPID is caused by different types of bacteria. Many times, it is caused by bacteria from STIs. The two most common STIs that cause PID are chlamydia and gonorrhea. Sometimes PID can be caused by normal bacteria found in the vagina. You can get PID if the bacteria move up from your vagina into your reproductive organs.\nThere are several ways women can get PID. The most common way is by having sex with a person who has an STI. These diseases are carried in the\xc2\xa0semen\xc2\xa0and other body fluids of infected people. During sexual contact, the germs spread to the woman\xe2\x80\x99s cervix. The germs can also infect the glands at the opening of the vagina, the urethra (passageway for urine), or the anus.\nSometimes PID can occur after the cervix is treated because of an abnormal Pap smear or after the insertion of an\xc2\xa0intrauterine\xc2\xa0device (IUD). However, this is not common. Rarely, PID can occur as a result of giving birth or having a miscarriage, abortion, or procedure to take a sample from the inside of the womb for laboratory testing.\nWhat are the risk factors for PID?\nThe same things that put you at risk for STIs also put you at risk for PID. Your risk for PID is higher if you:\nHave had an STI\nHave had PID before\nAre a sexually active woman younger than 25 years of age\nHave had multiple sexual partners\nHave unsafe sexual habits\nDouche (this can flush the bacteria up into your genital tract)\nHow is PID diagnosed?\nThere is no single test for PID. Your doctor will diagnose the condition based on your medical history, your symptoms, and a physical exam. He or she may also do some tests. They will do a pelvic exam. This can help them tell if any of your reproductive organs are tender. They may swab the area for a sample and have the sample tested for STIs. They may test for a urinary tract infection or other conditions that can cause pelvic pain. They might also do imaging tests, such as ultrasound. This uses sound waves to create pictures of your organs. It can help your doctor look for signs of PID.\nCan PID be prevented or avoided?\nMany cases of PID can be prevented in the same way that STIs are prevented. The only way to avoid an STI is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex.\nIf you are sexually active, you can lower your risk of getting an STI by:\nUsing condoms. Even though the condom will not prevent 100% of STIs, it will greatly reduce your chances of getting infected. Remember, only a condom can provide some protection against STIs. Other forms of birth control don\xe2\x80\x99t provide this protection.\nGetting tested. Make sure you and your partner are tested for STIs before you have sex. Tell each other the results.\nLimiting sexual partners. Your risk of getting an STI increases with the number of sexual partners you have.\nRemaining monogamous. This means having sex with only one partner.\nNot abusing alcohol or drugs. Drinking too much or using drugs can lead to risky behavior. It can increase your risk of being exposed to STIs.\nNot douching. Douching removes normal bacteria from your vagina that help to fight infections. It also helps bacteria travel up to other areas of the reproductive tract where they can cause infection.\nTreatment\nPID can be treated, especially if it is diagnosed early. It can usually be cured with antibiotics. It is very important that you take all of your medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to, even if your symptoms go away. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t take all the medicine, your symptoms may get worse. A few days after you start taking the medicine, your doctor may want to see you again for a checkup.\nThe sooner your PID is treated, the better. The longer PID is left untreated, the more damage it can cause, and the more likely there will be complications.\nHospitalization may be recommended if you are very sick with PID. It may also be needed if you are pregnant, are under the age of 18, or have HIV.\nShould my partner be treated if I have PID?\nIf you are treated for PID, especially if it\xe2\x80\x99s caused by an STI, your partner must also be treated. Unless your partner is treated, you may be infected again. Making good choices about sexual contact is important. If you think you might have PID, talk to your family doctor right away.\nLiving with PID\nWhat can happen to my body if I get PID?\nEarly and complete treatment can help prevent complications of PID. However, if PID isn\xe2\x80\x99t treated, it can cause permanent damage to your internal organs. Scar\xc2\xa0tissue\xc2\xa0can form in the fallopian tubes and around the abdomen. This tissue can prevent pregnancy. It can also cause the pregnancy to form outside the uterus. This is called a tubal or\xc2\xa0ectopic pregnancy. Scarring can cause pain that lasts for months or even years. Occasionally, the effects of PID can be so severe that surgery is required to remove pus, get rid of scar tissue, or remove damaged organs.\nPID is more likely to come back if you are exposed to STIs again. Each time you have PID, it causes more damage and a greater possibility of complications.\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor\nWhat is the likely cause of my pelvic inflammatory disease?\nDo I need any tests?\nWhat do my test results mean?\nWhat treatment option do you recommend?\nDoes my sexual partner need to be treated too?\nIs it safe for me to have sex now, or do I need to wait until after treatment?\nDo I have scar tissue or other damage to my organs?\nWill I have trouble getting pregnant?\nResources\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health, Pelvic inflammatory disease\nU.S. National Library of Medicine, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease\nLast Updated: August 6, 2018\nThis article was contributed by: familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCategories: WomenTags: cervix, chlamydia, discharge, fallopian, gonorrhea, infection, infertility, inflammatory, oophoritis, organs, pelvic, pelvic peritonitis, reproductive, sexually, sickness, sputum-ovarian abscess, system, vaginal\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.
