ParaGard prevents pregnancy for up to 10 years.\nParaGard is an intrauterine device (IUD) that can provide long-term birth control (contraception). It\'s sometimes referred to as a nonhormonal IUD option.\nThe ParaGard device is a T-shaped plastic frame that\'s inserted into the uterus. Copper wire coiled around the device produces an inflammatory reaction that is toxic to sperm and eggs (ova), preventing pregnancy.\nParaGard is the only copper IUD available in the United States. It can prevent pregnancy for up to 10 years after insertion.\nWhy it\'s doneParaGard offers effective, long-term contraception. It can be used in premenopausal women of all ages, including teenagers.\nAmong various benefits, ParaGard:\nEliminates the need to interrupt sex for contraception\nCan remain in place for up to 10 years\nCan be removed at any time\nCan be used while breast-feeding\nDoesn\'t carry the risk of side effects, such as blood clots, related to hormonal birth control methods\nCan be used for emergency contraception if inserted within five days after unprotected sex\nParaGard isn\'t appropriate for everyone. Your health care provider may discourage use of ParaGard if you:\nHave uterine abnormalities \xe2\x80\x94 such as large fibroids \xe2\x80\x94 that interfere with the placement or retention of ParaGard\nHave a pelvic infection, such as pelvic inflammatory disease\nHave uterine or cervical cancer\nHave unexplained vaginal bleeding\nAre allergic to any component of ParaGard\nHave a disorder that causes too much copper to accumulate in your liver, brain and other vital organs (Wilson\'s disease)\nRisksLess than 1 percent of women who use ParaGard will get pregnant in the first year of typical use.\nIf you do conceive while using ParaGard, you\'re at high risk of an ectopic pregnancy \xe2\x80\x94 when the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. But because ParaGard prevents most pregnancies, the overall risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is lower than it is for sexually active women who don\'t use contraception.\nParaGard doesn\'t offer protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nSide effects associated with ParaGard include:\nBleeding between periods\nCramps\nSevere menstrual pain and heavy bleeding\nIt\'s also possible to expel ParaGard from your uterus. You might not feel the expulsion if it occurs.\nYou may be more likely to expel ParaGard if you:\nHave never been pregnant\nHave heavy or prolonged periods\nHave severe menstrual pain\nPreviously expelled an IUD\nAre younger than age 25\nHad the IUD inserted immediately after childbirth\nHow you prepareParaGard can be inserted anytime during a normal menstrual cycle. If you just had a baby, your doctor might recommend waiting about eight weeks after delivery before inserting ParaGard.\nBefore inserting ParaGard, your health care provider will evaluate your overall health and do a pelvic exam. You may have a pregnancy test to confirm you\'re not pregnant, and you may be screened for STIs.\nTaking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), one to two hours before the procedure can help reduce cramping.\nWhat you can expect\nParaGard placementParaGard placementParaGard is an intrauterine device (IUD) that\'s inserted into the uterus by a health care provider. ParaGard prevents pregnancy for up to 10 years.\nParaGard is typically inserted in a health care provider\'s office.\nDuring the procedureYour health care provider will insert a speculum into your vagina and clean your vagina and cervix with an antiseptic solution. A special instrument might be used to gently align your cervical canal and uterine cavity. Next, your health care provider will fold down ParaGard\'s horizontal arms and place the device inside an applicator tube.\nThe tube is inserted into your cervical canal and ParaGard is carefully placed in your uterus. When the applicator tube is removed, ParaGard will remain in place. Your health care provider will trim ParaGard\'s strings so that they don\'t protrude too far into the vagina and may record the length of the strings.\nDuring ParaGard insertion, you may experience dizziness, fainting, nausea, low blood pressure or a slower than normal heart rate. Your health care provider will likely suggest that you stay lying down for a few minutes to allow these side effects to pass. Rarely, it\'s possible for the IUD to perforate the uterine wall or cervix. If this complication occurs, your health care provider will discuss the appropriate management.\nAfter the procedureAbout a month after ParaGard is inserted, your health care provider may re-examine you to make sure the device hasn\'t moved and to check for signs and symptoms of infection.\nWhile you\'re using ParaGard, contact your health care provider immediately if you have:\nSigns or symptoms of pregnancy\nUnusually heavy vaginal bleeding\nFoul vaginal discharge\nWorsening pelvic pain\nSevere abdominal pain or tenderness\nUnexplained fever\nPossible exposure to an STI\nIt\'s also important to contact your health care provider immediately if you think your ParaGard is no longer in place. Call your doctor if:\nYou have breakthrough bleeding or bleeding after sex\nSex is painful for you or your partner\nThe strings are missing or suddenly seem longer\nYou feel part of the device at your cervix or in your vagina\nYour health care provider will check the location of ParaGard and remove it if necessary.\nRemovalParaGard is usually removed in a health care provider\'s office. Your provider will likely use forceps to grasp the device\'s strings and gently pull. The device\'s arms will fold upward as it\'s withdrawn from the uterus.\nLight bleeding and cramping are common during removal. Rarely, removal can be more complicated.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nRequest an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\nSept. 07, 2019\nPrint\nShare on: FacebookTwitter\nShow references\nHatcher RA, et al.
