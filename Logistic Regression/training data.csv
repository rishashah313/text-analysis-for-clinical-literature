(""Hyper"" means ""over"" in Greek). Thyroid hormones include thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). T3 is actually the most active thyroid hormone. Much of the T4 is converted to T3 in the bloodstream.The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of the neck. The thyroid gland itself is regulated by the pituitary gland in the brain, and the pituitary gland is regulated by the hypothalamus, another gland in the brain.Thyrotoxicosis is a toxic condition that is caused by an excess of thyroid hormones from any cause. Thyrotoxicosis can be caused by an excessive intake of thyroid hormone or by overproduction of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland.\nThyroid Disease Symptoms/Signs\nHyperthyroidism and Hypothyroidism\nThyroid disease can result from the over- or under-function of the thyroid gland. An overactive thyroid produces too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism), and an underactive thyroid produces too little thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism).\nSigns and symptoms of hyperthyroidism include:\nNervousness\nIrritability\nIncreased appetite\nHeart palpitations\nHeat intolerance\nSigns and symptoms of hypothyroidism include:\nMental sluggishness\nDepressed mood\nWeight gain\nDecreased heart rate\nIncreased cold sensitivity\nLearn the other thyroid disease symptoms and signs \xc2\xbb\nWhat are hyperthyroidism symptoms and signs?\nReaders Comments 62\nShare Your Story\nHyperthyroidism is suggested by several signs and symptoms; however, people with mild disease usually experience no symptoms. People 70 years of age and older may not have any symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism. In general, the symptoms become more obvious as the degree of hyperthyroidism increases. The symptoms usually are related to an increase in the metabolic rate of the body.Common symptoms include:Excessive sweatingHeat intoleranceIncreased bowel movementsTremor (usually fine shaking)Nervousness, agitation, anxietyRapid heart rate, palpitations, irregular heart rateWeight lossFatigue, weaknessDecreased concentrationIrregular and scant periods (menstruation)Fine or brittle hairRapid heartbeatThinning and/or smooth velvety skinSleep disturbancesIn older people, irregular heart rhythms and heart failure can occur. In its most severe form, untreated hyperthyroidism may result in ""thyroid storm,"" a condition involving high blood pressure, fever, and heart failure. Mental changes, such as confusion and delirium, also may result.What is the difference between hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidsm?\nHyperthyroidism refers to an increased production of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland, while hypothyroidism refers to a condition in which a person has too little thyroid hormone or underproduction of thyroid hormones.\nIMAGES\nHyperthyroidism (Symptoms, Causes, Treatment Medication, Diet)\nSee a medical illustration of the thyroid plus our entire medical gallery of human anatomy and physiology\nSee Images\nWhat causes hyperthyroidism?\nReaders Comments 1\nShare Your Story\nSome common causes of hyperthyroidism include:Graves\' DiseaseFunctioning adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG)Excessive intake of thyroid hormonesAbnormal secretion of TSHThyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland)Excessive iodine intakeGraves\' disease\nGraves\' disease, which is caused by a generalized overactivity of the thyroid gland, and is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In this condition, the thyroid gland usually has lost the ability to respond to the normal control by the pituitary gland via TSH (renegade). Graves\' disease is hereditary and is up to five times more common among women than men.Graves\' disease is thought to be an autoimmune disease, and antibodies that are characteristic of the illness may be found in the blood. These antibodies include thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI antibodies), thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO), and TSH receptor antibodies.Graves\' disease symptoms and signsSigns and symptoms of Graves\xe2\x80\x99 disease include those of hyperthyroidism; however, Graves\xe2\x80\x99 disease may be associated with eye disease (Graves\' opthalmopathy) and skin lesions (dermopathy). Opthalmopathy can occur before, after, or at the same time as the hyperthyroidism. Early on, it may cause sensitivity to light and a feeling of ""sand in the eyes."" The eyes may be reddened and produce excess tears. Swelling behind the eyeballs causes the eyes to protrude, and double vision can occur. The degree of opthalmopathy is worsened in those who smoke.In addition to the symptoms of hyperthyroidism mentioned above, Graves\' disease may be associated with eye disease (Graves\' opthalmopathy) and skin lesions (dermopathy). Opthalmopathy can occur before, after, or at the same time as the hyperthyroidism. Early on, it may cause sensitivity to light and a feeling of ""sand in the eyes."" The eyes may be reddened and produce excess tears. Swelling behind the eyeballs causes the eyes to protrude, and double vision can occur. The degree of opthalmopathy is worsened in those who smoke.The course of the eye disease is often independent of the thyroid disease, and steroid medications may be necessary to control the inflammation that causes the opthalmopathy. In addition, surgical intervention may be required. The skin condition (dermopathy) is rare and causes a painless, red, lumpy skin rash on the front of the legs.Graves\' disease triggersThe triggers for Graves\' disease include:stress,smoking,radiation to the neck,medications, andinfectious organisms such as viruses.Graves\' disease can be diagnosed by a standard, nuclear medicine thyroid scan, which shows diffusely increased uptake of a radioactively labeled iodine. In addition, a blood test may reveal elevated TSI levels.\nLatest Thyroid News\nThyroid Surgery Complications\nLook for Early Signs of Thyroid Cancer\nHealth Tip: Differing Thyroid Tests\nWhy Are Doctors Removing Too Many Thyroids?\nThyroid Cancer Survivors at Risk for Heart Disease\nWant More News?

This condition is associated with signs and symptoms of fever and sore throat , often with painful swallowing. The thyroid gland is also tender to touch. There may be generalized neck aches and pains. Inflammation of the gland with an accumulation of white blood cells known as lymphocytes (lymphocytic thyroiditis) may also occur. In both of these conditions, the inflammation leaves the thyroid gland ""leaky,"" so that the amount of thyroid hormone entering the blood is increased. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is most common after a pregnancy and can actually occur in up to 8% of women after delivery. In these cases, the hyperthyroid phase can last from 4 to 12 weeks and is often followed by a hypothyroid (low thyroid output) phase that can last for up to 6 months. The majority of affected women return to a state of normal thyroid function. Thyroiditis can be diagnosed by a thyroid scan.Other causes of hyperthyroidism\nFunctioning adenoma and toxic multinodular goiterAs we age, lumps or nodules may form in the thyroid gland. Usually, these lumps do not produce thyroid hormones and require no treatment. Occasionally, a nodule may become ""autonomous,"" which means that it does not respond to pituitary regulation and produces thyroid hormones independently. This becomes more likely if the nodule is larger than 3 cm. When there is a single nodule that is independently producing thyroid hormones, it is called a functioning nodule. If there is more than one functioning nodule, the term toxic, multinodular goiter is used. Functioning nodules may be readily detected with a thyroid scan.Excessive intake of thyroid hormonesTaking too much thyroid hormone medication is actually quite common. Excessive doses of thyroid hormones frequently go undetected due to the lack of follow-up of patients taking their thyroid medicine. Other persons may be abusing the drug in an attempt to achieve other goals such as weight loss.Abnormal secretion of TSHA tumor in the pituitary gland may produce an abnormally high secretion of TSH (the thyroid stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary gland). This leads to excessive signaling to the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. This condition is very rare and can be associated with other abnormalities of the pituitary gland. To identify this disorder, an endocrinologist performs elaborate tests to assess the release of TSH.Excessive iodine intakeThe thyroid gland uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. An excess of iodine may cause hyperthyroidism. Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is usually seen in patients who already have an underlying abnormal thyroid gland. Certain medications, such as amiodarone (Cordarone), which is used in the treatment of heart problems, contain a large amount of iodine and may be associated with thyroid function abnormalities.\nSLIDESHOW\nHyperthyroidism Symptoms and Treatment\nSee Slideshow\nWhat tests are used for the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism?\nA blood test can confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Usually, in hyperthyroidism or overactive thyroid, blood levels of thyroid hormones are elevated. However, there is one exception. If the excessive amount of thyroid hormone is due to a TSH-secreting pituitary tumor, then the levels of TSH will be abnormally high. This uncommon disease is known as ""secondary hyperthyroidism.""Although the blood tests mentioned previously can confirm the presence of excessive thyroid hormone, they do not point to a specific cause. A combination of antibody screening (for Graves\' disease) and a thyroid scan using radioactively labeled iodine (which concentrates in the thyroid gland) can help diagnose the underlying thyroid disease. Graves\' disease is almost certain if there are obvious signs and symptoms that affect the eyes. Tests for hyperthyroidism are based on an individual basis.\nSubscribe to MedicineNet\'s General Health NewsletterBy clicking Submit, I agree to the MedicineNet\'s Terms & Conditions & Privacy Policy and understand that I may opt out of MedicineNet\'s subscriptions at any time.\nMedications for hyperthyroidism treatment\nReaders Comments 41\nShare Your Story\nThe options for treating hyperthyroidism include, treating the symptoms of the condition with medications, antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and surgery.Medications that immediately treat hyperthyroidism symptoms caused by excessive thyroid hormones, such as a rapid heart rate, include beta-blockers, for example, propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), and metoprolol (Lopressor). These medications counteract the effect of thyroid hormone to increase metabolism, but they do not alter the levels of thyroid hormones in the blood. A doctor determines which patients to treat based on a number of variables including the underlying cause of hyperthyroidism, the age of the patient, the size of the thyroid gland, and the presence of coexisting medical illnesses.Antithyroid drugs\nThere are two main antithyroid drugs available for use in the United States to treat hyperthyroidism, methimazole (Tapazole) and propylthiouracil (PTU). The major risk of these medications is occasional suppression of production of white blood cells by the bone marrow (agranulocytosis). (White cells are needed to fight infection.) It is impossible to tell if or when this side effect is going to occur, so regular determination of white blood cells in the blood are not useful.Rarely, methimazole or propylthiouracil may cause fever, sore throat, or other signs of infection. If you develop these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.Usually, long-term antithyroid therapy is only used for people with Graves\' disease, since this disease may actually go into remission under treatment without requiring treatment with thyroid radiation or surgery. If treated from 1 to 2 years, data shows remission rates of 40%-70%. When the disease is in remission, the gland is no longer overactive, and antithyroid medication is not needed.Studies also have shown that adding a pill of thyroid hormone to the antithyroid medication results in higher remission rates. This type of therapy remains controversial, however. When long-term therapy is withdrawn, patients should continue to be seen by the doctor every three months for the first year, since a relapse of Graves\' disease is most likely in this time. If a patient does relapse, antithyroid drug therapy can be restarted, or radioactive iodine or surgery may be considered.\nFrom\nHealthy Resources\nTop Causes of Hearing Loss9 Questions to Ask Before Having SurgeryAre Generics Just As Good?\nFeatured Centers\nGood and Bad Foods for Psoriasis\nHealth Solutions From Our Sponsors\nThe Science of Addiction\nIs It Normal to Have a Curved Penis?\nRadioactive iodine\nRadioactive iodine is given orally (either by pill or liquid) on a one-time basis to ablate a hyperactive gland. The iodine given for ablative treatment is different from the iodine used in a scan. Radioactive iodine is given after a routine iodine scan, and uptake of the iodine is determined to confirm hyperthyroidism. There are no widespread side effects with this therapy.Usually, more than 80% of patients are cured with a single dose of radioactive iodine. It takes between 8 to 12 weeks for the thyroid to become normal after therapy. Permanent hypothyroidism is the major complication of this form of treatment. While a temporary hypothyroid state may be seen up to 6 months after treatment with radioactive iodine, if it persists longer than 6 months, thyroid replacement therapy usually is begun.Thyroidectomy (hyperthyroidism surgery)\nWith the introduction of radioactive iodine therapy and antithyroid drugs, surgery for hyperthyroidism (thyroidectomy) is less common. When this therapy is necessary, it is used in:Pregnant women and children who have major adverse reactions to antithyroid medications.People with very large thyroid glands and in those who have symptoms stemming from compression of tissues adjacent to the thyroid, such as difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, and shortness of breath.Partial thyroidectomy (removal of a portion of the thyroid gland) was once a common treatment for hyperthyroidism. The goal is to remove the thyroid tissue that was producing the excessive thyroid hormone. However, if too much tissue is removed, an inadequate production of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) may result. In this situation, thyroid replacement therapy is started.The major complication of thyroid surgery is disruption of the surrounding tissue, including the nerves supplying the vocal cords and the four tiny glands in the neck that regulate calcium levels in the body (the parathyroid glands). Accidental removal of these glands may result in low calcium levels (hypercalcemia) and require calcium replacement therapy.What should I do if I think I have hyperthyroidism?\nIf you are concerned that you may have an excess amount of thyroid hormone, you should mention your symptoms to your doctor. A simple blood test is the first step in the diagnosis. From there, both you and your doctor can decide what the next step should be. If treatment is needed, it is important for you to let your doctor know of any concerns or questions you have about the options available. Remember that thyroid disease is very common, and the diseases that cause an excess of thyroid hormones can be easily diagnosed and treated.Which types of doctors treat hyperthyroidism?\nEndocrinologists are specialists in diagnosing and treating hormonal disorders such as hyperthyroidism. Primary care physicians, including family practitioners and internists, may also be involved in treating patients with hyperthyroidism. Ophthalmologists and ophthalmic surgeons may be involved in the care of patients with Graves\' disease.\nQUESTION\nWhere is the thyroid gland located?\nSee Answer\nHealth Solutions From Our Sponsors\nPenis Curved When Erect\nMS Tips\nOpioid Addiction\nPediatric Hospital 101\nHolistic Cancer Care\nAnswers for Infant Reflux\nMedically Reviewed on 11/20/2019\nReferences\nREFERENCE:<http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/121865-overview>\nYou are about to visit a website outside of medicinenet.

Heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, myocarditis, and cardiomyopathies are just a few potential causes of congestive heart failure. Signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure may include fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, angina, and edema. Physical examination, patient history, blood tests, and imaging tests are used to diagnose congestive heart failure. Treatment of heart failure consists of lifestyle modification and taking medications to decrease fluid in the body and ease the strain on the heart. The prognosis of a patient with congestive heart failure depends on the stage of the heart failure and the overall condition of the individual.\nELISA TestsELISA stands for ""enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.""

Leg pain can occur in the foot, ankle, knee, behind the knee, thigh, down the back of the leg, or in any part of the leg. It can occur at night, while lying down, or while running or\nexercising, depending upon the cause. Depending on the cause, leg pain can occur in one leg only or in both legs. Typically, the leg pain is a result of tissue inflammation that is caused by injury or disease. Either injury or chronic disease can cause inflammation to any of the tissues of the leg and lead to leg pain. Since the leg contains a number of different structures and tissue types, a wide variety of conditions and injuries can cause leg pain.\nDepending on the cause of the pain, other symptoms, like\nweakness,\nnumbness,\nthrobbing,\ncramps,\naching, or\na tingling sensation, may accompany leg pain.\nDiabetic neuropathy (nerve damage from diabetes) is a common cause of tingling, burning, and numbness in the legs that can at times be painful. For diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, it is important to differentiate the exact type and location of any pain in the legs. Peripheral artery disease can cause claudication, or pain that occurs in the legs usually when walking or exercising.\nBlood clots (deep vein thrombosis) can be another cause of leg pain. Pain in the knee and ankle joints of the leg is common with the arthritis conditions. The pain of sciatica (from disc disease of the spine) may radiate down the leg and is another common cause of leg pain.\nRelated Symptoms & Signs\nJoint PainLeg SwellingMuscle Cramps\nOther causes of leg pain\nBacterial Infections\nElectrolyte Imbalances\nFungal Infections\nLegg-Calv\xc3\xa9-Perthes Disease\nMedications\nNerve Damage From Any Source\nRupture of Ligaments or Tendons\nSlipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis\nSynovitis\nTears in Cartilage\nTrauma\nTumors\nUlcerations of the Skin\nViral Infections\nNext Article\nsymptomchecker\nHealth concerns on your mind?

Take the Rheumatoid...\nCauses of Leg Pain\nAnkle Pain (Tendinitis)\nAnkle pain is commonly due to a sprain or tendinitis.\nThe severity of ankle sprains ranges from mild (which can resolve within 24 hours) to severe (which can require surgical repair). Tendinitis of the ankle can be caused by trauma or inflammation.\nArthritis (Joint Inflammation)\nArthritis is inflammation of one or more joints. When joints are inflamed they can develop stiffness, warmth, swelling, redness and pain. There are over 100 types of arthritis, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, gout, and pseudogout.\nBroken Bone\nA broken bone is a fracture. There are different types of fractures, such as:\ncompressed,\nopen,\nstress,\ngreenstick,\nspiral,\nvertebral compression,\ncompound, and\ncomminuted.\nSymptoms of a broken bone include pain at the site of injury, swelling, and bruising around the area of injury. Treatment of a fracture depends on the type and location of the injury.\nBurns (First Aid)\nBurn types are based on their severity: first-degree burns, second-degree burns, and third-degree burns. First-degree burns are similar to a painful sunburn. The damage is more severe with second-degree burns, leading to blistering and more intense pain. The skin turns white and loses sensation with third-degree burns. Burn treatment depends upon the burn location, total burn area, and intensity of the burn.\nBursitis\nA bursa is a fluid-filled sac found in the joints that cushions them. Bursitis is an inflammation of the bursae, most commonly caused by repetitive motion. Bursitis can be caused by a bacterial infection and should be treated with antibiotics. Doctors also recommend icing and resting the joint.\nCellulitis\nCellulitis is an acute spreading bacterial infection below the surface of the skin characterized by redness, warmth, inflammation, and pain. The most common cause of cellulitis is the bacteria staph (Staphylococcus aureus).\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT)\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease affects the peripheral nerves. CMT symptoms and signs include weakness of the lower leg muscles and foot, foot drop, foot deformities, etc. There are several forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Inherited gene mutations are the cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. There is no cure for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, however, therapeutic measures and mild exercise may help symptoms.\nChondromalacia Patella (Patellofemoral Syndrome)\nChondromalacia patella (housemaid\'s knee or secretary\'s knee) results from misalignment of the kneecap as it slides over the lower end of the thigh bone. Symptoms include tightness or fullness in the knee area, swelling, and mild discomfort. Treatment includes the use of anti-inflammatory medications, in addition to stretching, strengthening and icing the knee.\nCold Agglutinin Disease\nCold agglutinin hemolytic anemia or cold agglutinin hemolytic disease, is rare disorder of the autoimmune system. There are two types of cold agglutinin disease, primary and secondary. Characteristics, symptoms, and signs of in cold agglutinin disease are premature destruction of red blood cells in the body\xe2\x80\x99s natural defense antibodies. The lifespan of red blood cells is approximately 120 before the spleen destroys the antibodies. In cold agglutinin disease, the severity of the condition is determined by how long it takes for the red blood cells to survive, and at the rate that the bone marrow continues to produce more red cells. Immune hemolytic anemias are classified by the optimal temperature when the antibodies try to destroy red blood cells. Cold agglutinin anemia occurs at temperatures between 10 C (50 F) and 37 C (F 98.6) or above while the body warms antibody hemolytic anemia. Usually, cold agglutinin anemia becomes apparent between the ages of 50 to 60. Other symptoms of the disease include fatigue, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), fingers and/or toes are cold and sweat, an uneven bluish or reddish discoloration of the toes, ankles, and wrists (Raynaud\'s syndrome), and fingers.\nUsually, cold agglutinin anemia affects people that are older. The disease is diagnosed by a physical exam, and the Coomb\'s test. If the red blood cells destruction seem to be slowing on its own, treatment therapies, usually, isn\xe2\x80\x99t needed. Other treatments for cold agglutinin anemia are corticosteroids, and splenectomy (removal of the spleen). There is no cure for cold agglutinin disease.\nCuts, Scrapes (Abrasions), and Puncture Wounds\nCuts, scrapes, and puncture wounds are common, and most people will experience one of these in their lifetime. Evaluating the injury, and thoroughly cleaning the injury is important. Some injuries should be evaluated by a doctor, and a tetanus shot may be necessary. Treatment will depend upon the severity of the injury.\nDeep Vein Thrombosis (DVT, Blood Clot in the Legs)\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot in the deep veins, and can be caused by broken bones, trauma to a limb, immobility, medications, smoking, cancer, genetic predisposition, and cancer. Symptoms of a deep vein thrombosis in a leg are swelling, tenderness, redness, warmth, and pain. Treatments for DVT include medications and surgery.\nDiabetes (Type 1 and Type 2)\nDiabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. The two types of diabetes are referred to as type 1 (insulin dependent) and type 2 (non-insulin dependent). Symptoms of diabetes include increased urine output, thirst, hunger, and fatigue. Treatment of diabetes depends on the type.\nDiabetic Neuropathy (Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis, Treatment)\nDiabetic neuropathy a condition in which nerve damage has occurred as a\ncomplication of diabetes. The pain from the nerve damage can be severe with\ntingling or numbness in the part of the body affected. Diabetic neuropathy can\noccur anywhere in the body. Diabetic neuropathy can cause symptoms like intense pain, numbness,\nburning, or tingling in the part of the body affected by the condition.\nThere are four types of neuropathy include peripheral, autonomic, proximal and focal.\nNatural therapies and medications may help relieve the pain and other symptoms\nof diabetic neuropathy.\nFatigue\nFatigue can be described in various ways. Sometimes fatigue is described as feeling a lack of energy and motivation (both mental and physical). The causes of fatigue\nare generally related to a variety of conditions or diseases, for example,\nanemia,\nmono, medications,\nsleep problems,\ncancer,\nanxiety,\nheart disease, and\ndrug abuse.Treatment of fatigue is generally directed toward the condition or disease that is causing the fatigue.\nGout\nBuildup of uric acid crystals in a joint causes gouty arthritis. Symptoms and signs include joint pain, swelling, heat, and redness, typically of a single joint. Gout may be treated with diet and lifestyle changes, as well as medication.\nGuillain-Barre Syndrome\nGuillain-Barr\xc3\xa9 Syndrome is an autoimmune disease of the nervous system due to damage to the myelin sheath around nerves. It is the most acquired nerve disease (neuropathy) and usually follows a virus infection but can also be associated with immunizations, surgery, and childbirth. The cause is unknown but appears to be related to autoimmune reaction. Symptoms include weakness beginning in the legs and progressing upward, lost reflexes, and in severe cases breathing can be affected. Patients can expect a slow but progressive recovery over several months maintaining vital functions and passively exercising the muscles. Plasmapheresis (removing toxic substances from the blood) has been shown to improve outcome and shorten the disease as well as intravenous immunoglobulin.\nHamstring Injury\nHamstring injuries may range from minor strains to major ruptures. A hamstring injury causes spasm, tightness, and tenderness. More severe injuries may cause swelling and bruising. While most hamstring injuries heal without surgery, a complete rupture would require surgery.\nHerniated Disc\nA herniated disc may be caused by injury or degeneration from age. Symptoms depend on the location of the herniation and whether nerve tissue is being irritated. An MRI or CT scan is performed to diagnose a herniated disc. Treatment may involve physical therapy, cortisone injection, pain medications, anti-inflammatory medications, muscle relaxants, and surgery.\nIliotibial Band Syndrome\nIliotibial band syndrome is an overuse injury of the thigh and knee. Symptoms include knee pain and possible swelling. Treatment may involve anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, ultrasound, massage, using a foam roller at the site of pain, and the use of orthotics.\nLumbar Spinal Stenosis\nLumbar stenosis can be caused by degenerative arthritis (the most common cause), tumor, infection, or metabolic disorders (Paget\'s disease of the bone). Symptoms include low back pain, weakness, pain, numbness, and loss of sensation in the legs. Other conditions may cause similar symptoms of lumbar stenosis, including diabetic neuropathy, claudication, and peripheral vascular disease. Lumbar stenosis may be treated with medication or surgery.\nLupus (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or SLE)\nSystemic lupus erythematosus is a condition characterized by chronic inflammation of body tissues caused by autoimmune disease. Lupus can cause disease of the skin, heart, lungs, kidneys, joints, and nervous system. When only the skin is involved, the condition is called discoid lupus.\nWhen internal organs are involved, the condition is called systemic lupus\nerythematosus (SLE).\nMuscle Cramps\nMuscle cramps are involuntarily and forcibly contracted muscles that do not relax. Extremely common, any muscles that have voluntary control, including some organs, are subject to cramp. Since there is such variety in the types of muscle cramps that can occur, many causes and preventative medications are known. Stretching is the most common way to stop or prevent most muscle cramps.\nMuscle Spasms\nMuscle spasms are involuntary muscle contractions that come on suddenly and are usually quite painful. Dehydration, doing strenuous exercise in a hot environment, prolonged muscle use, and certain diseases of the nervous system may cause muscle spasms. Symptoms and signs of a muscle spasm include an acute onset of pain and a possible bulge seen or felt beneath the skin where the muscle is located. Gently stretching the muscle usually resolves a muscle spasm.\nOsgood-Schlatter Disease\nOsgood-Schlatter disease, a painful inflammation just below the knee but above the shin, typically affects adolescent boys. Symptoms include localized pain, inflammation, swelling, and calcification. Osgood-Schlatter disease typically goes away over time, however, symptoms can be helped with anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving medications, ice, and rest.\nOsteoarthritis (OA)\nOsteoarthritis is a type of arthritis caused by inflammation, breakdown, and eventual loss of\ncartilage in the joints. Also known as degenerative arthritis, osteoarthritis can be caused by aging, heredity, and injury from trauma or disease.\nOsteomyelitis\nOsteomyelitis is an infection of the bone. Potential causes include injections around the bone, fractures that puncture the skin, recent surgeries, and bacterial infections that travel from other areas of the body, spreading through the blood to the bone. Symptoms include pain, fever, chills, stiffness, and nausea. Treatment involves antibiotics and pain medications. Surgery is sometimes necessary.\nPeripheral Vascular Disease\nPeripheral vascular disease (PVD) refers to diseases of the blood vessels (arteries and veins) located outside the heart and brain. While there are many causes of peripheral vascular disease, doctors commonly use the term peripheral vascular disease to refer to peripheral artery disease (peripheral arterial disease, PAD), a condition that develops when the arteries that supply blood to the internal organs, arms, and legs become completely or partially blocked as a result of atherosclerosis.\nPeripheral artery disease symptoms include intermittent\nleg pain while walking,\nleg pain at rest, numbness in the legs or feet, and poor wound healing in\nthe legs or feet.\nTreatment for peripheral artery disease include lifestyle measures, medication, angioplasty, and surgery.\nPiriformis Syndrome\nPiriformis syndrome may develop if the piriformis muscle spasms and compresses the sciatic nerve. This causes buttock pain that radiates down the back of the leg along the sciatic nerve. Symptoms include numbness, a pins-and-needles tingling sensation, and low back pain. Treatment of piriformis syndrome depends upon the syndrome\'s phase: acute, recovery, or maintenance.\nPseudogout\nPseudogout, a form of arthritis, results when deposits of crystals collect in and around the joints. Symptoms of pseudogout include pain, stiffness, warmth, and joint swelling of the knees, ankles, hips, shoulders, and/or wrists. Treatment for pseudogout aims to decrease inflammation through the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ice, and rest.\nPsoriasis\nPsoriasis is a long-term skin condition that may cause large plaques of red, raised skin, flakes of dry skin, and skin scales. There are several types of psoriasis, including psoriasis vulgaris, guttate psoriasis, inverse psoriasis, and pustular psoriasis. Symptoms vary depending on the type of psoriasis the patient has. Treatment of psoriasis may include creams, lotions, oral medications, injections and infusions of biologics, and light therapy. There is no cure for psoriasis.\nQuadriceps Injury\nThere are many types of quadriceps injuries, including strains, contusions, Osgood-Schlatter disease, patellar tendinitis, quadriceps tendinitis, jumper\'s knee, tendinitis, compartment syndrome, rupture, and herniation. Symptoms and signs of a quadriceps injury including pain, swelling, limping, and decreased range of motion. Treatment of most quad injuries includes rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Ibuprofen may help with pain relief.\nRestless Leg Syndrome\nRestless leg syndrome (RLS) is a common cause for painful legs that typically eases with motion, and becomes worse and more noticeable at rest. This characteristic nighttime worsening can frequently lead to insomnia. Treatment of the symptoms of restless leg syndrome is generally with medication as well as treating any underlying condition causing restless leg syndrome.\nRheumatoid Arthritis (RA)\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation of the joints, the tissue around the joints, as well as other organs in the body. Because it can affect multiple other organs of the body, rheumatoid arthritis is referred to as a systemic illness and is sometimes called rheumatoid disease. The 16 characteristic early RA signs and symptoms include the following.\nAnemia\nBoth sides of the body affected (symmetric)\nDepression\nFatigue\nFever\nJoint deformity\nJoint pain\nJoint redness\nJoint stiffness\nJoint swelling\nJoint tenderness\nJoint warmth\nLimping\nLoss of joint function\nLoss of joint range of motion\nMany joints affected (polyarthritis)\nSciatica\nSciatica pain, caused by irritation of the sciatic nerve, typically radiates from the low back to behind the thigh to below the knee. Disc herniation is usually the cause of sciatica. Medication to alleviate pain, physical therapy, and bed rest are treatments for sciatica.\nShin Splints\nShin splints result from inflammation from injury to the tendon and adjacent tissues in the front of the outer leg. Shin splints commonly occur in runners or aggressive walkers, causing pain and discomfort. An increase in workout intensity, weak ankles and pronation may be to blame for shin splints. Stretching, strengthening, and icing the affected area are effective treatments for shin splints. Rest and anti-inflammatory medications are also advised.\nSprains and Strains\nAn injury to a ligament is called a sprain, and an injury to muscle or tendon is called a strain.\nSprains and strains may be caused by repetitive movements or a single stressful incident. Symptoms and signs include pain and swelling. Though treatment depends upon the extent and location of the injury, rest, ice, compression, and elevation are key elements of treatment.\nVaricose Veins\nVaricose vein: A dilated (widened) tortuous (twisting) vein, usually involving a superficial vein in the leg, often associated with incompetency of the valves in the vein. These visible and bulging veins are often associated with symptoms such as tired, heavy, or aching limbs. Spider veins are a group of widened veins that can be seen through the surface of the skin.\nExamples of Medications for Leg Pain\nKetorolac vs. diclofenac\nKetorolac vs. ibuprofen (Advil)\nKetorolac vs. naproxen (Aleve)\nNonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\nUltram (tramadol) Side Effects, Warnings, and Interactions\nSymptoms & Signs A-Z List\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nJ\nK\nL\nM\nN\nO\nP\nQ\nR\nS\nT\nU\nV\nW\nX\nY\nZ\nFrom\nArthritis Resources\nTips to Pamper Your JointsFoods That Help Rheumatoid ArthritisHow Well Are You Living With AS?\nFeatured Centers\nGood and Bad Foods for Psoriasis\nHealth Solutions From Our Sponsors\nThe Science of Addiction\nIs It Normal to Have a Curved Penis?\nSubscribe to MedicineNet\'s Arthritis Newsletter\nBy clicking ""Submit,"" I agree to the MedicineNet Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\nI also agree to receive emails from MedicineNet and I understand that I may opt out of MedicineNet subscriptions at any time.\nMedically Reviewed on 9/10/2019\nReferences\nKasper, D.L., et al., eds.

It is most often due to injury, such as fracture, that causes bleeding in a muscle, which then causes increased pressure in the muscle. This pressure increase causes nerve damage due to decreased blood supply.Symptoms include severe pain, numbness, and decreased range of motion.Surgery (fasciotomy) is the only treatment for acute compartment syndrome. The muscle compartment is cut open to allow muscle tissue to swell, decrease pressure and restore blood flow.Complications may include muscle loss, amputation, infection, nerve damage, and kidney failure.Prevention efforts include ice and elevation of the affected extremity.Chronic compartment syndrome usually requires no treatment or surgery.What is compartment syndrome?\nCompartment syndrome is a condition that occurs when injury causes generalized painful swelling and increased pressure within a compartment to the point that blood cannot supply the muscles and nerves with oxygen and nutrients. Muscles in the forearm, lower leg and other body areas are\nsurrounded by fibrous bands of tissues. This creates distinct compartments. The\nfibrous tissue is very inflexible and cannot stretch to accommodate the\ngeneralized swelling. If left untreated, muscles and nerves fail and may\neventually die.\nWhile most often occurring in the forearm and lower leg, compartment syndrome can rarely occur in other parts of the body that have muscles contained in compartments, including the hands and feet.\nCompartment syndrome may occur acutely due to swelling that arises from injury, or it may be chronic because of exertion\nsuch as exercise.\nCompartment Syndrome Symptoms\nSymptoms of chronic compartment syndrome (exertional compartment syndrome)\ninclude aching or cramping in the affected muscle (buttock, thigh, or lower leg)\nwithin a half-hour of starting exercise. Symptoms usually go away with rest, and\nmuscle function remains normal. Exertional compartment syndrome can feel like\nshin splints and be confused with that condition.\nSOURCE:WebMD Medical Reference\nWhat causes compartment syndrome?\nMuscles are contained in compartments covered by thick fibrous bands of tissue or fascia. Because of injury, pressure can increase within the compartment to swelling (fluid accumulation) or bleeding. In non-contracting muscle, the compartment pressure is normally about 0-15 mmHg of pressure. If the pressure within the compartment increases (usually greater than about 30 -45mmHg;\nor are within 30 mm of the diastolic blood pressure) most individuals develop compartment syndrome. When these high compartment pressures are present, blood cannot circulate to the muscles and nerves to supply them with oxygen and nutrients.\nSymptoms such as pain and swelling will result.\nAs the muscle cells lose their blood and oxygen supply, they begin to die. If the condition is not recognized and treated, the whole muscle can die, scar down, and contract. Similarly, nerve cells that are damaged may fail causing numbness and weakness in the structures beyond the injury site. If infection or necrosis develops, the individual may need the limb amputated to prevent death.\nPicture of Compartment Syndrome\nWhat are the risk factors for compartment syndrome?\nAcute compartment syndrome occurs as a complication of an injury. Often it is due to a fracture of the radius or ulna in the forearm or the tibia and fibula in the lower leg that causes significant bleeding in one or more of the compartments. Bleeding can also be due to a badly bruised muscle. Crush injuries may cause both bleeding and swelling of a muscle.\nSome injuries can be more subtle. If a person is incapacitated and immobile for a prolonged period of time, for example, due to alcohol or drug intoxication, swelling or muscle damage may occur because a blood vessel was compressed. The weight of an object (or the weight of the body itself) compressing a muscle group can cause rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown).\nCompartment swelling may occur after the blood supply is re-established (reperfusion swelling) to an area that has lost it for a period of time. Two examples are: 1) a person is in an auto accident\nwhere their legs are trapped and compressed with heavy debris, which are subsequently freed from the debris after a period of time; 2) when a blood vessel is damaged and subsequently repaired through surgery.\nCompartment syndrome may be a complication of bandages or casts that are applied too tightly, or due to swelling that occurs\nafter casting.\nOther abrupt causes of compartment syndrome include burns, snake bites and other envenomation, and anabolic steroid use. Individuals taking anticoagulants have a higher risk for compartment syndrome after trauma\ndue to bleeding that cannot clot normally. Because there is some controversy about when fasciotomy is required (especially with snake bites)\nimmediate consultation with a surgeon is recommended by most experts.\nChronic compartment syndrome occurs because of excessive exercise, where repetitive motion and muscle use cause localized swelling and irritation. Most often, symptoms in the legs are seen with runners and bicyclists and in the arms of swimmers. Symptoms resolve with rest and very rarely progress to an acute limb threatening situation.\nIMAGES\nCompartment Syndrome\nSee a medical illustration of compartment syndrome plus our entire medical gallery of human anatomy and physiology\nSee Images\nWhat are the symptoms and signs of compartment syndrome?\nReaders Comments 6\nShare Your Story\nThe symptoms of compartment syndrome, plus the circumstances that led to their development assist to make the clinical diagnosis. Pain out of proportion to the injury (or physical examination of the muscle compartment) often is the clue to make the diagnosis of compartment syndrome. Increased pressure within the muscle compartment causes loss of blood supply and nerve inflammation. This causes significant pain and numbness or paresthesia. (para=abnormal + ethesia=feeling).\nThe diagnosis should be always considered when there is either an associated fracture, high velocity injury like a gunshot wound or a crush injury. Individuals who are taking anticoagulant medications such as warfarin (Coumadin) or enoxaparin (Lovenox) are at higher risk for bleeding into a compartment spontaneously or after injury.\nHistorically, the mnemonic memory device for compartment syndrome is the ""5\nPs"" (pain, paresthesia [change in sensation], pallor [pale coloration],\nparalysis, and poikilothermia [inability to control temperature]; some authors\ninclude pulselessness), but this should not be relied upon to make a diagnosis. Only pain and change in sensation (parathesia) may be symptoms that point to the diagnosis of a developing compartment syndrome.\nExamination of the extremity often reveals tense and shiny skin that may be significantly bruised. Pain occurs with minimal range of motion of the foot, hand, or any of the extremity with compartment syndrome. The patient may have difficulty moving the extremity without assistance and pain is provoked when the care practitioner takes the affected limb though any range of motion\nIn chronic compartment syndrome, there may be pain with range of motion of the extremity and muscle bulging may be noticed. Numbness is common but all symptoms usually resolve within a few minutes of discontinuing exercise.\nLatest Exercise & Fitness News\nWalking During Work Meetings Bring Benefits\nHow to Exercise on \'Rest and Recovery\' Days\nHealth Tip: Treating a Charley Horse\nWeight-Free Strength Training\nHealth Tip: Benefits of Fitness Boxing\nWant More News?

If the pressure within the compartment is not released within a few hours, permanent muscle and nerve damage may occur.\nMedical care should be accessed when numbness, tingling, weakness, or excessive pain occurs after an injury. While compartment syndrome is most often due to injuries of the forearm and lower leg, it may also occur in the hand, foot,\nor buttocks after a broken bone or crush injury.How is compartment syndrome diagnosed?\nReaders Comments 2\nShare Your Story\nWhile it is uncommon, the health care practitioner has to have a high index of suspicion for acute compartment syndrome if a patient presents with excessive pain, numbness, and a tense extremity after an injury. The patient\'s history of\nan injury to the extremity often is all that is necessary for a diagnosis.\nWhile blood tests may be ordered to look for chemical markers of muscle injury (for example, myoglobin and lactate levels) and kidney damage, the definitive diagnosis of compartment syndrome is confirmed by measuring the pressure within the compartments of the affected limb. A sterile needle is inserted directly into the muscle compartment and attached to a pressure monitoring device (see second-last reference for picture). Usually, pressure measurements (see values listed above) are taken in each compartment in the affected limb and this may require multiple needle sticks.\nChronic compartment syndrome may be diagnosed clinically but compartment pressures may be measured before and after exercise to confirm the diagnosis. The health care\nprofessional should also explore other potential causes of pain due to exercise, including stress fractures, shin splints, or tendon inflammation.\nQUESTION\nEmotional trauma is best described as a psychological response to a deeply distressing or life-threatening experience.\nSee Answer\nWhat is the treatment for compartment syndrome?\nReaders Comments 2\nShare Your Story\nPrevention is the first step in the treatment of compartment syndrome. Significant injuries of the arms and legs that require casting or splinting should always be elevated and iced to minimize the potential for swelling. Elevation should be above the level of the heart. Ice therapy may even be considered even if a cast or splint has been placed.\nChronic or exercise induced compartment syndrome rarely requires any treatment; the pain and other symptoms usually stop minutes to hours after the activity is stopped. However, some individuals, over time, find the chronic compartment syndrome to be very limiting, especially if it causes them to stop a favorite sport (for example, running, tennis, or football). Rarely, such individuals may have a surgeon cut open some of the fascia that\nsurrounds the compartment to reduce or stop the symptoms.Surgery (fasciotomy)\nReaders Comments 2\nShare Your Story\nThe treatment for acute compartment syndrome is surgery (fasciotomy). The surgeon (either an orthopedic or general surgeon) will perform a fasciotomy (see last reference for video of procedure), an operation where the thick, fibrous bands that line the muscles are filleted open, allowing the muscles to swell and relieve the pressure within the compartment (similar to splitting open the casing of a sausage). Depending upon the amount of swelling (edema), a second operation may be required later to close the skin after the swelling has resolved.\nOnce acute compartment syndrome has occurred, there is no non-surgical alternative. Hyperbaric oxygen may be considered as an adjunct treatment after surgery to promote healing.\nTreatment will also be directed to the underlying cause of the compartment syndrome and to try to prevent other associated complications including kidney failure due to rhabdomyolysis.\nSubscribe to MedicineNet\'s Skin Care & Conditions Newsletter\nBy clicking ""Submit,"" I agree to the MedicineNet Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\nI also agree to receive emails from MedicineNet and I understand that I may opt out of MedicineNet subscriptions at any time.\nWhat are the complications of compartment syndrome?\nReaders Comments 6\nShare Your Story\nLeft unrecognized or untreated, the complications of acute compartment syndrome are irreversible. As swelling increases and muscle loses its blood supply, cells eventually die and muscle necrosis occurs. Complications include:muscle scarring, contracture and loss of function of the limb;infection;amputation;permanent nerve damage; and/orrhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) and kidney damage.Complications due to chronic or exercise induced compartment syndrome are rare but may include any of the above, especially if the person requires surgery to alleviate the chronic condition.What is the prognosis for compartment syndrome?\nAcute compartment syndrome is a potentially devastating condition. Return of normal function and minimizing injury depends upon quick recognition of the situation and prompt surgical fasciotomy to resolve the increased pressure. The longer the delay to surgery, the more potential for permanent loss of muscle and nerve function. The prognosis for chronic compartment syndrome is usually excellent.\nFrom\nHealthy Resources\nIs It a Break or a Sprain?Are We Close to a Cure for Cancer?First Aid for Someone Having a Seizure\nFeatured Centers\nGood and Bad Foods for Psoriasis\nHealth Solutions From Our Sponsors\nThe Science of Addiction\nIs It Normal to Have a Curved Penis?\nHealth Solutions From Our Sponsors\nPenis Curved When Erect\nMS Tips\nOpioid Addiction\nPediatric Hospital 101\nHolistic Cancer Care\nAnswers for Infant Reflux\nReferences\nMedically reviewed by Avrom Simon, MD; Board Certified Preventative Medicine with Subspecialty in Occupational Medicine\nREFERENCE.\nBucholz RW, et.al., Rockwood and Green\'s Fracture in\nAdults. 6th ed.

There are different types of fractures, such as:\ncompressed,\nopen,\nstress,\ngreenstick,\nspiral,\nvertebral compression,\ncompound, and\ncomminuted.\nSymptoms of a broken bone include pain at the site of injury, swelling, and bruising around the area of injury. Treatment of a fracture depends on the type and location of the injury.\nBroken FootA broken foot is a common injury. There are 26 bones in the foot, and these\nbones can be broken (fractured) in a variety of ways. Signs and symptoms of a\nbroken bone in the foot are pain, swelling, redness, bruising, and limping\nbecause the person is not able to walk on the affected foot. You can tell if you\nhave a broken foot by medical examination that includes imaging studies. The\nhealing and recovery time for a broken bone in the foot depends upon the type of\nfracture and the bones broken.\nBurns (First Aid)Burn types are based on their severity: first-degree burns, second-degree burns, and third-degree burns. First-degree burns are similar to a painful sunburn. The damage is more severe with second-degree burns, leading to blistering and more intense pain. The skin turns white and loses sensation with third-degree burns. Burn treatment depends upon the burn location, total burn area, and intensity of the burn.\nCompartment Syndrome PictureA condition in which there is swelling and an increase in pressure within a limited space (a compartment) that presses on and compromises blood vessels, nerves, and/or tendons that run through that compartment. See a picture of Compartment Syndrome and learn more about the health topic.\nHematoma Pictures, Symptoms, Causes, and TreatmentA hematoma is a collection of blood that is outside a blood vessel. There are different\nareas where hematomas occur including; inside the skull, on the scalp,\nears, septum, bones, finger nails, toe nails, and intra-abdominal.\nHemophiliaHemophilia is defined as one of a group of inherited bleeding disorders. Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are inherited in an X-linked recessive genetic pattern. Symptoms of hemophilia include bleeding into the:\njoints,\nmuscles,\nGI or urinary tract,\nor brain or skull.\nHemophilia treatment generally involves the replacement of blood clotting factors.\nInternal BleedingInternal bleeding occurs when an artery or vein is damaged and blood to escapes the circulatory system and collects inside the body. Internal bleeding can be caused by a variety of situations such as blunt trauma, deceleration trauma, medications, fractures, and spontaneous bleeding. Treatment of internal bleeding depends on the cause of the bleeding.\nKidney (Renal) Failure Kidney failure can occur from an acute event or a chronic condition or disease. Prerenal kidney failure is caused by blood loss, dehydration,\nor medication. Some of the renal causes of kidney failure include\nsepsis, medications,\nrhabdomyolysis,\nmultiple myeloma, and acute glomerulonephritis.\nPost renal causes of kidney failure include\nbladder obstruction, prostate problems, tumors, or\nkidney stones.Treatment options included diet, medications, or dialysis.\nQuadriceps InjuryThere are many types of quadriceps injuries, including strains, contusions, Osgood-Schlatter disease, patellar tendinitis, quadriceps tendinitis, jumper\'s knee, tendinitis, compartment syndrome, rupture, and herniation. Symptoms and signs of a quadriceps injury including pain, swelling, limping, and decreased range of motion. Treatment of most quad injuries includes rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Ibuprofen may help with pain relief.\nRhabdomyolysisRhabdomyolysis is a rapid deterioration and destruction of skeletal muscle. Some of the causes of rhabdomyolysis include:\nsevere burns,\nmuscle trauma,\ncoma,\nseizures,\nelectrolyte imbalance,\nmedications (statins),\nviruses, and\nbacteria.\nTreatment of rhabdomyolysis depends on the cause.\nQuestions To Ask Before SurgerySurgery is the branch of medicine that employs operations in the treatment of disease or injury.

Davis, MD, PhDThe brain is the body organ composed of nerve cells and supportive tissues like glial cells and meninges \xe2\x80\x93 there are three major parts \xe2\x80\x93 they control your activity like breathing (brain stem), activity like moving muscles to walk (cerebellum) and your senses like sight and our memory, emotions, thinking and personality (cerebrum).Primary brain tumors can be either malignant (contain cancer cells) or benign (do not contain cancer cells). A primary brain tumor is a tumor which begins in the brain tissue. If a cancerous tumor starts elsewhere in the body, it can spread cancer cells, which grow in the brain. These types of tumors are called secondary or metastatic brain tumors.Brain tumors can occur at any age.Researchers and doctors do not know exact cause of brain tumors.Risk factors include exposure to ionizing radiation and family history of brain tumors.The signs symptoms of brain tumors depend on their size, type, and location. The most common signs symptoms include headaches; numbness or tingling in the arms or legs; seizures; memory problems; mood and personality changes; balance and walking problems; nausea and vomiting; or changes in speech, vision, or hearing.Doctors group brain tumors are classified by grade (grade I, grade II, grade III, or grade IV -the most severe). The grade is determined by the way the cells look under a microscope. The higher the grade number, the more abnormal the cells appear, and the more aggressively the tumor usually behaves.The most common types of primary brain tumors among adults are astrocytoma, meningiom (a tumor that arises from the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord) and oligodendroglioma.The most common type of primary brain tumors in children are medulloblastoma, grade I or II astrocytoma, (or glioma) ependymoma, and brain stem glioma.Studies have found risk factors for brain tumors to include ionizing radiation from high dose X-rays (for example, radiation therapy where the machine is aimed at the head), and family history.Diagnosis of a brain tumor is done by a neurologic exam (by a neurologist or neurosurgeon), CT (computer tomography scan) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and other tests like an angiogram, spinal tap and biopsy. Your diagnosis helps predict the treatment.Neurologists base the treatment of brain tumors on the type, location, and size of the tumor, your health, and age. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy (or a combination of treatments).Supportive care is important before, during, and after treatment to minimize symptoms, and to improve your quality of life.What is necessary to qualify for clinical trials for brain tumor treatment?\xc2\xa0Some patients can qualify for clinical trials by contacting\n12 Early Warning Signs and Symptoms of a Brain Lesion\nSymptoms of a brain lesion depend upon what part of the brain is affected. Large parts of the brain can be involved in some diseases and there may be relatively few symptoms. Alternatively, very tiny lesions may be catastrophic if they occur in a critical part of the brain.Initial signs and symptoms of a brain lesion are often non-specific and may include:\nWorst headache of your life\nNausea\nFever (if an infection is present)\nNeck pain and stiffness (if the meninges are inflamed)\nVision, speech problems, and difficulty forming words\nWeakness or paralysis to one side of the body\nSeizures\nPersonality changes, loss of concentration, aggression and loss of personal control\nClick for more about lesions on the brain \xc2\xbb\nWhat are brain tumors?\nA tumor in the brain isn\xe2\x80\x99t like tumors in other parts of your body. It has limited room for growth because of the skull. This means that a growing tumor can squeeze vital parts of the brain and lead to serious health problems. Learning about the possible symptoms of brain tumors can help you know when to tell a doctor about them.What are the early warning symptoms and signs of a brain tumor?\nReaders Comments 76\nShare Your Story\nCancer that has spread to the brain from another part of the body is called a metastatic brain tumor. Metastatic brain tumors are much more common than primary tumors.\xc2\xa0The symptoms of a brain tumor depend on tumor size, type, and location. Symptoms may be caused when a tumor presses on a nerve or harms a part of the brain. Also, they may be caused when a tumor blocks the fluid that flows through and around the brain, or when the brain swells because of the buildup of fluid.The most common early warning symptoms and signs of brain tumors include:A new onset or change in pattern of headachesHeadaches in the morningHeadaches that gradually become more frequent and severeNausea and vomiting for no reasonChanges in speech, vision, or hearingProblems balancing or walkingChanges in mood, personality, or ability to concentrateProblems with memoryMuscle jerking or twitching (seizures or convulsions)Numbness or tingling in the arms or legsGradual loss of sensation or movement in an arm or a legConfusion in everyday mattersPersonality or behavior changesMost often, these symptoms are not due to a brain tumor. Another health problem could cause them. If you have any of these symptoms, you should tell your doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated early before it has grown. Some people with brain tumors have seizures, especially in someone who does not have a history of seizures.\nSLIDESHOW\nBrain Cancer Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment\nSee Slideshow\nWhat are the types of benign and cancerous brain tumors?\nReaders Comments 65\nShare Your Story\nWhen most normal cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. New cells form when the body doesn\'t need them, and old or damaged cells don\'t die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor. There are two types of brain tumors, primary and cancerous.Primary brain tumors can be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).Usually, benign tumors can be removed, and they seldom grow back.Benign brain tumors usually have an obvious border or edge. Cells from benign tumors rarely invade tissues around them.They don\'t spread to other parts of the body.Benign tumors can press on sensitive areas of the brain and cause serious health problems.Unlike benign tumors in most other parts of the body, benign brain tumors are sometimes life threatening.Benign brain tumors may become turn into cancer.Malignant brain tumors (also called brain cancer) contain cancer cells:Malignant brain tumors are generally more serious and often are a threat to life.They are likely to grow rapidly and crowd or invade the nearby healthy brain tissue.Cancer cells may break away from malignant brain tumors and spread to other parts of the brain or to the spinal cord. They rarely spread to other parts of the body.What are the grades for benign and cancerous brain tumors?\nDoctors group brain tumors by grade. The grade of a tumor refers to the way the cells look under a microscope:Grade I: The tissue is benign. The cells look nearly like normal brain cells, and they grow slowly.Grade II: The tissue is malignant. The cells look less like normal cells than do the cells in a Grade I tumor.Grade III: The malignant tissue has cells that look very different from normal cells. The abnormal cells are actively growing (anaplastic).Grade IV: The malignant tissue has cells that look most abnormal and tend to grow quickly.Cells from low-grade tumors (grades I and II) look more normal and generally grow more slowly than cells from high-grade tumors (grades III and IV).\xc2\xa0Over time, a low-grade tumor may become a high-grade tumor. However, the change to a high-grade tumor happens more often among adults than children.\nLatest Neurology News\nFDA OKs First Nasal Spray for Seizure Clusters\nThe Best Exercises for Brain Health\nBrief EMS Training Saves Lives After Brain Injury\nCan Medical Marijuana Help Kids With Autism?\nNew Treatment Focuses on Tourette Syndrome\nWant More News?

Primary brain tumors are named according to the type of cells or the part of the brain in which they begin. For example, most primary brain tumors begin in glial cells. This type of tumor is called a glioma.Among adults, the most common types are:Astrocytoma: The tumor arises from star-shaped glial cells called astrocytes. It can be any grade. In adults, an astrocytoma most often arises in the cerebrum.Grade I or II astrocytoma: It may be called a low-grade glioma.Grade III astrocytoma: It\'s sometimes called a high-grade or an anaplastic astrocytoma.Grade IV astrocytoma: It may be called a glioblastoma or malignant astrocytic glioma.Meningioma: The tumor arises in the meninges. It can be grade I, II, or III. It\'s usually benign (grade I) and grows slowly.Oligodendroglioma: The tumor arises from cells that make the fatty substance that covers and protects nerves. It usually occurs in the cerebrum. It\'s most common in middle-aged adults. It can be grade II or III.Among children, the most common types and stages of brain tumors\xc2\xa0are:Medulloblastoma: The tumor usually arises in the cerebellum. It\'s sometimes called a primitive neuroectodermal tumor. It is grade IV.Grade I or II astrocytoma: In children, this low-grade tumor occurs anywhere in the brain. The most common astrocytoma among children is juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma. It\'s grade I.Ependymoma: The tumor arises from cells that line the ventricles or the central canal of the spinal cord. It\'s most commonly found in children and young adults. It can be grade I, II, or III.Brain stem glioma: The tumor occurs in the lowest part of the brain. It can be a low-grade or high-grade tumor. The most common type is diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.\nQUESTION\nCancer is the result of the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells anywhere in the body.\nSee Answer\nWhat are the causes and risk factors for brain tumors?\nWhen you\'re told that you have a brain tumor, it\'s natural to wonder what may have caused your disease. But no one knows the exact causes of brain tumors. Doctors seldom know why one person develops a brain tumor and another doesn\'t.Researchers are studying whether people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop a brain tumor. A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of getting a disease.Studies have found the following risk factors for brain tumors:Ionizing radiation: Ionizing radiation from high dose x-rays (such as radiation therapy from a large machine aimed at the head) and other sources can cause cell damage that leads to a tumor. People exposed to ionizing radiation may have an increased risk of a brain tumor, such as meningioma or glioma.Family history: It is rare for brain tumors to run in a family. Only a very small number of families have several members with brain tumors.Researchers are studying whether using cell phones, having had a head injury, or having been exposed to certain chemicals at work or to magnetic fields are important risk factors. Studies have not shown consistent links between these possible risk factors and brain tumors, but additional research is needed.\nSubscribe to MedicineNet\'s Cancer Report Newsletter\nBy clicking ""Submit,"" I agree to the MedicineNet Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\nI also agree to receive emails from MedicineNet and I understand that I may opt out of MedicineNet subscriptions at any time.\nWhat procedures and tests diagnose the type and grade of a brain tumor?\nIf you have symptoms that suggest a brain tumor, your doctor will give you a physical exam and ask about your personal and family health history. You may have one or more of the following tests:Neurologic exam: Your doctor checks your vision, hearing, alertness, muscle strength, coordination, and reflexes. Your doctor also examines your eyes to look for swelling caused by a tumor pressing on the nerve that connects the eye and the brain.MRI: A large machine with a strong magnet linked to a computer is used to make detailed pictures of areas inside your head. Sometimes a special dye (contrast material) is injected into a blood vessel in your arm or hand to help show differences in the tissues of the brain. The pictures can show abnormal areas, such as a tumor.CT scan: An x-ray machine linked to a computer takes a series of detailed pictures of your head. You may receive contrast material by injection into a blood vessel in your arm or hand. The contrast material makes abnormal areas easier to see. Your doctor may ask for other tests:Angiogram: Dye injected into the bloodstream makes blood vessels in the brain show up on an x-ray. If a tumor is present, the x-ray may show the tumor or blood vessels that are feeding into the tumor.Spinal tap: Your doctor may remove a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that fills the spaces in and around the brain and spinal cord). This procedure is performed with local anesthesia. The doctor uses a long, thin needle to remove fluid from the lower part of the spinal column. A spinal tap takes about 30 minutes. You must lie flat for several hours afterward to keep from getting a headache. A laboratory checks the fluid for cancer cells or other signs of problems.Biopsy: The removal of tissue to look for tumor cells is called a biopsy. A pathologist looks at the cells under a microscope to check for abnormal cells. A biopsy can show cancer, tissue changes that may lead to cancer, and other conditions. A biopsy is the only sure way to diagnose a brain tumor, learn what grade it is, and plan treatment. Surgeons can obtain tissue to look for tumor cells in two ways:Biopsy at the same time as treatment: The surgeon takes a tissue sample when you have surgery to remove part or all of the tumor. See the Surgery section.Stereotactic biopsy: You may get local or general anesthesia and wear a rigid head frame for this procedure. The surgeon makes a small incision in the scalp and drills a small hole (a burr hole) into the skull. CT or MRI is used to guide the needle through the burr hole to the location of the tumor. The surgeon withdraws a sample of tissue with the needle. A needle biopsy may be used when a tumor is deep inside the brain or in a part of the brain that can\'t be operated on.However, if the tumor is in the brain stem or certain other areas, the surgeon may not be able to remove tissue from the tumor without harming normal brain tissue. In this case, the doctor uses MRI, CT, or other imaging tests to learn as much as possible about the brain tumor.Questions to ask the doctor before a brain tumor biopsyWhy do I need a biopsy? How will the biopsy results affect my treatment plan?What kind of biopsy will I have?How long will it take? Will I be awake? Will it hurt?What are the chances of infection or bleeding after the biopsy? Are there any other risks?How soon will I know the results?If I do have a brain tumor, who will talk with me about treatment?

Some people worry that the doctor will be offended if they ask for a second opinion. Usually the opposite is true. Most doctors welcome a second opinion. And many health insurance companies will pay for a second opinion if you or your doctor requests it. Some companies require a second opinion.If you get a second opinion, the doctor may agree with your first doctor\'s diagnosis and treatment plan. Or the second doctor may suggest another approach. Either way, you\'ll have more information and perhaps a greater sense of control. You can feel more confident about the decisions you make, knowing that you\'ve looked at your options.It may take some time and effort to gather your medical records and see another doctor. In many cases, it\'s not a problem to take several weeks to get a second opinion. The delay in starting treatment usually won\'t make treatment less effective. To make sure, you should discuss this delay with your doctor. Some people with a brain tumor need treatment right away.There are many ways to find a doctor for a second opinion. You can ask your doctor, a local or state medical society, a nearby hospital, or a medical school for names of specialists.Also, you can request a consultation with specialists at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.Adults and children with a brain tumor: Specialists in the NCI Neuro-Oncology Branch provide consultations. The telephone number is 301-594-6767 or 866-251-9686.Children with a brain tumor: Specialists in the NCI Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Section of the Pediatric Oncology Branch provide consultations. The telephone number is 301-496-8009 or 877-624-4878.\nWhat are the treatments for benign and cancerous brain tumors?\nReaders Comments 4\nShare Your Story\nPeople with brain tumors have several treatment options. The options are surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Many people get a combination of treatments.The choice of treatment depends mainly are:The type and grade of brain tumorIts location in the brainIts sizeYour age and general healthFor some types of brain cancer, the doctor also needs to know whether cancer cells were found in the cerebrospinal fluid.Your doctor can describe your treatment choices, the expected results, and the possible side effects. Because cancer therapy often damages healthy cells and tissues, side effects are common. Before treatment starts, ask your health care team about possible side effects and how treatment may change your normal activities. You and your health care team can work together to develop a treatment plan that meets your medical and personal needs.You may want to talk with your doctor about taking part in a clinical trial, a research study of new treatment methods. See the Taking Part in Cancer Research section.Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, or you may ask for a referral. Specialists who treat brain tumors include neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and neuroradiologists.Your health care team may also include an oncology nurse, a registered dietitian, a mental health counselor, a social worker, a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, a speech therapist, and a physical medicine specialist. Also, children may need tutors to help with schoolwork. (The Rehabilitation section has more information about therapists and tutors.)Questions to ask your doctor before having brain tumor treatmentWhat type of brain tumor do I have?Is it benign or malignant?What is the grade of the tumor?What are my treatment choices? Which do you recommend for me? Why?What are the expected benefits of each kind of treatment?What can I do to prepare for treatment?Will I need to stay in the hospital? If so, for how long?What are the risks and possible side effects of each treatment? How can side effects be managed?What is the treatment likely to cost? Will my insurance cover it?How will treatment affect my normal activities? What is the chance that I will have to learn how to walk, speak, read, or write after treatment?Would a research study (clinical trial) be appropriate for me?Can you recommend other doctors who could give me a second opinion about my treatment options? How often should I have checkups?\nWhat is the most common type of surgery to remove brain tumors?\nReaders Comments 8\nShare Your Story\nSurgery is the usual first treatment for most brain tumors. Before surgery begins, you may be given general anesthesia, and your scalp is shaved. You probably won\'t need your entire head shaved.Surgery to open the skull is called a craniotomy. The surgeon makes an incision in your scalp and uses a special type of saw to remove a piece of bone from the skull.You may be awake when the surgeon removes part or all of the brain tumor. The surgeon removes as much tumor as possible. You may be asked to move a leg, count, say the alphabet, or tell a story. Your ability to follow these commands helps the surgeon protect important parts of the brain.After the tumor is removed, the surgeon covers the opening in the skull with the piece of bone or with a piece of metal or fabric. The surgeon then closes the incision in the scalp.Sometimes surgery isn\'t possible. If the tumor is in the brain stem or certain other areas, the surgeon may not be able to remove the tumor without harming normal brain tissue. People who can\'t have surgery may receive radiation therapy or other treatment.You may have a headache or be uncomfortable for the first few days after surgery. However, medicine can usually control pain. Before surgery, you should discuss the plan for pain relief with your health care team. After surgery, your team can adjust the plan if you need more relief.You may also feel tired or weak. The time it takes to heal after surgery is different for everyone. You will probably spend a few days in the hospital.Other, less common problems may occur after surgery for a brain tumor. The brain may swell or fluid may build up within the skull. The health care team will monitor you for signs of swelling or fluid buildup. You may receive steroids to help relieve swelling. A second surgery may be needed to drain the fluid. The surgeon may place a long, thin tube (shunt) in a ventricle of the brain. (For some people, the shunt is placed before performing surgery on the brain tumor.) The tube is threaded under the skin to another part of the body, usually the abdomen. Excess fluid is carried from the brain and drained into the abdomen. Sometimes the fluid is drained into the heart instead.Infection is another problem that may develop after surgery. If this happens, the health care team will give you an antibiotic.Brain surgery may harm normal tissue. Brain damage can be a serious problem. It can cause problems with thinking, seeing, or speaking. It can also cause personality changes or seizures. Most of these problems lessen or disappear with time. But sometimes damage to the brain is permanent. You may need physical therapy, speech therapy, or occupational therapy. See the Rehabilitation section.Questions should you ask your surgeon before having a brain tumor removedDo you suggest surgery for me?How will I feel after the operation?What will you do for me if I have pain?How long will I be in the hospital?Will I have any long-term effects? Will my hair grow back? Are there any side effects from using metal or fabric to replace the bone in the skull?When can I get back to my normal activities?What is my chance of a full recovery?\nWhat is radiation treatment for brain tumors?\nRadiation therapy kills brain tumor cells with high-energy x-rays, gamma rays, or protons.Radiation therapy usually follows surgery. The radiation kills tumor cells that may remain in the area. Sometimes, people who can\'t have surgery have radiation therapy instead.Doctors use external and internal types of radiation therapy to treat brain tumors:External radiation therapy: You\'ll go to a hospital or clinic for treatment. A large machine outside the body is aimed to direct beams of radiation at either the whole brain or more commonly, at specific portions of the brain. Some people need radiation aimed at the spinal cord also. The treatment schedule depends on your age, and the type and size of the tumor. Fractionated external beam therapy, in which small doses or fractions of radiation are given usually once each day, is the most common method of radiation therapy used for people with brain tumors. Giving the total dose of radiation over several weeks helps to protect healthy tissue in the area of the tumor. Treatments are usually 5 days a week for several weeks. A typical visit lasts less than an hour, and each treatment takes only a few minutes.Some treatment centers are studying other ways of delivering external beam radiation therapy:Intensity-modulated radiation therapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy: These types of treatment use computers to more closely target the brain tumor to lessen the damage to healthy tissue.Proton beam radiation therapy: The source of radiation is protons rather than X-rays. The doctor aims the proton beam at the tumor. The dose of radiation to normal tissue from a proton beam is less than the dose from an X-ray beam.Stereotactic radiation therapy: Narrow beams of X-rays or gamma rays are directed at the tumor from different angles. For this procedure, you wear a rigid head frame. The therapy may be given during a single visit (stereotactic radiosurgery) or over several visits.Internal radiation therapy (implant radiation therapy or brachytherapy): Internal radiation isn\'t commonly used for treating brain tumors and is under study. The radiation comes from radioactive material usually contained in very small implants called seeds. The seeds are placed inside the brain and give off radiation for months. They don\'t need to be removed once the radiation is gone.Some people have no or few side effects after treatment. Rarely, people may have nausea for several hours after external radiation therapy. The health care team can suggest ways to help you cope with this problem. Radiation therapy also may cause you to become very tired with each radiation treatment. Resting is important, but doctors usually advise people to try to stay as active as they can.Also, external radiation therapy commonly causes hair loss from the part of the head that was treated. Hair usually grows back within a few months. Radiation therapy also may make the skin on the scalp and ears red, dry, and tender.

What are heel spur symptoms?\nReaders Comments 4\nShare Your Story\nA heel spur is a pointed bony outgrowth of the bone of the heel (the calcaneus bone). Chronic local inflammation at the insertion of soft-tissue tendons or plantar fascia is a common cause of bone spurs (osteophytes). Heel spurs can be located at the back of the heel or under the heel, beneath the arch of the foot. Heel spurs at the back of the heel are frequently associated with inflammation of the Achilles tendon (tendinitis) and cause tenderness and heel pain made worse while pushing off the ball of the foot.\nSymptom of Heel Spurs\nHeel Pain\nPain in the heel can result from a number of factors. Abnormalities of the skin, nerves, bones, blood vessels, and soft tissues of the heel can all result in pain. Because of walking and daily movement, we are always at risk for injury or trauma to the heel area. Common causes of pain in the heel include blisters and corns. Plantar fasciitis, inflammation of the ""bowstring-like"" tissue in the sole of the foot stretching from the heel to the front of the foot, is one condition commonly associated with heel pain.\nRead more about causes of heel pain \xc2\xbb\nHow do heel spurs relate to plantar fasciitis? What causes heel spurs?\nReaders Comments 2\nShare Your Story\nHeel spurs under the sole of the foot (plantar area) are associated with inflammation of the plantar fascia (plantar fasciitis), the ""bowstring-like"" ligament stretching underneath the sole that attaches at the heel. Plantar heel spurs cause localized tenderness and heel\xc2\xa0pain made worse when stepping down on the heel.Heel spurs and plantar fasciitis can occur alone or be related to underlying diseases that cause arthritis (inflammation of the joints), such as reactive arthritis (formerly called Reiter\'s disease), ankylosing spondylitis, and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). It is important to note that heel spurs may cause no symptoms at all and may be incidentally discovered during X-ray exams taken for other purposes.How do health care professionals diagnose heel spurs?\nHeel spurs are diagnosed based on the history of heel pain and tenderness localized to the area of bony involvement. They are specifically identified when there is point tenderness at the bottom of the heel, which makes it difficult to walk barefoot on hard surfaces, like tile or wood floors. X-ray examination of the foot is used to identify the bony prominence (spur) of the heel bone (calcaneus).\nSLIDESHOW\nBurning or Swollen Feet? What Foot Pain Says About Your Health\nSee Slideshow\nWhat are heel spur treatment options? Are there any home remedies for heel spurs?\nReaders Comments 18\nShare Your Story\nHeel spurs are treated by measures that decrease the associated inflammation and avoid reinjury. Local ice applications both reduce pain and inflammation. Anti-inflammatory medications, such as naproxen (Aleve) and\xc2\xa0ibuprofen (Advil), or injections of cortisone, are often helpful.Orthotic devices or shoe inserts are used to take pressure off plantar spurs (donut-shaped insert), and heel lifts can reduce stress on the Achilles tendon to relieve painful bone spurs at the back of the heel. Similarly, sports running shoes with soft, cushioned soles can be helpful in reducing irritation of inflamed tissues from heel spurs. Infrequently, surgery is performed on chronically inflamed spurs.What is the prognosis (outlook) of heel spurs?\nThe long-term outlook is generally good. The inflammation usually responds to conservative, nonsurgical treatments, like anti-inflammatory drugs and orthotics. Infrequently, surgical intervention is necessary.Is it possible to prevent heel spurs?\nTreating any underlying associated inflammatory disease can prevent heel spurs.\nLatest Chronic Pain News\nCould CBD Treat Opioid Addiction?\nLess Pain, More Car Crashes: Legalized Marijuana\nHypnotherapy, Alternative to Opioids for Pain?\nScientists Spot Unexpected Player in Fibromyalgia\n1 in 4 American Workers Struggles With Back Pain\nWant More News?

Usually, the disorder affects the nerves that provide sensation, which causes pain, tingling, and burning symptoms of the nerves affected.Usually, peripheral neuropathy occurs in the feet and hands.Many other diseases and conditions can cause peripheral neuropathy, for example, drugs, diabetes, shingles, kidney failure, and vitamin deficiency.Peripheral neuropathy is diagnosed by exams, diagnostic and blood tests, and occasionally, skin biopsies.The treatment for peripheral neuropathy depends on the cause; however, the prognosis for many of the diseases and other medical problems that cause peripheral neuropathy can be successfully treated or prevented.\nPeripheral Neuropathy Symptoms and Causes\nPeripheral neuropathy is damage to the peripheral nerves and results in a tingling, painful, or burning sensation in the extremities. It most commonly occurs in the legs. Other symptoms of peripheral neuropathy can include weakness and numbness. Poorly controlled diabetes is one of the most common causes of peripheral neuropathy, but a number of conditions can be responsible for damage to the peripheral nerves. Examples of other causes include:\nalcoholism,\nkidney failure,\nvitamin deficiency, and\nshingles.\nSome medications, including certain cancer chemotherapy drugs, can cause peripheral neuropathy.\nLearn more about peripheral neuropathy symptoms and causes \xc2\xbb\nWhat is peripheral neuropathy?\nReaders Comments 100\nShare Your Story\nPeripheral neuropathy is a disorder of nerve(s) apart from the brain and spinal cord. Patients with peripheral neuropathy may have tingling, numbness, unusual sensations, weakness, or burning pain in the affected area. Oftentimes, the symptoms are symmetrical and involve both hands and feet. Because the symptoms are often present in the areas covered by gloves or stockings, peripheral neuropathy is often described as having a ""glove and stocking"" distribution of symptoms.Peripheral neuropathy can involve different nerve types, including motor, sensory, and autonomic nerves. Peripheral neuropathy can also be categorized by the size of the nerve fibers involved, large, or small.Neuropathy can present with many differing symptoms, including numbness, pain of different types, weakness, or loss of balance, depending on the type of nerve involved. Because the autonomic nerves control bodily functions that we do not consciously think of, such as heart rate, digestion, and emptying of the bowel and bladder, autonomic neuropathy manifests with symptoms affecting the loss of control of these functions. Symptoms may include problems with blood pressure, voiding, passage of stools (diarrhea, or constipation), heart rate, or sweating.Cranial neuropathy is similar to peripheral neuropathy, except that the cranial nerves are involved. Any of the cranial nerves can be involved. One of the more common causes of cranial neuropathy is loss of blood flow from the optic artery to the optic nerve, causing ischemic optic neuropathy. Amyloidosis is one of the more common causes of this rare disorder.Specific nerves can be involved in neuropathy. When a specific nerve is involved, the symptoms are limited to the distribution of that nerve. The most commonly involved peripheral nerve is the median nerve at the wrist in carpal tunnel syndrome. Essentially any peripheral nerve can become entrapped and cause the signs and symptoms of neuropathy. The ulnar nerve is commonly entrapped at the elbow. The peroneal nerve is exposed at the outer part of the knee. The pudendal nerve can cause pain in the perineum and is relieved by sitting on a toilet seat or an inflatable donut. Entrapment of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve at the waist, called meralgia paresthetica, causes numbness at the outer part of the thigh.\nSLIDESHOW\nDiabetic Peripheral Neuropathy: Improve Diabetes Nerve Pain\nSee Slideshow\nWhat causes peripheral neuropathy?\nReaders Comments 1\nShare Your Story\nThere are many possible causes of peripheral neuropathy, including:Diabetes mellitusShingles (post herpetic neuralgia)Vitamin deficiency, particularly B12 and folateAlcoholAutoimmune diseases, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or Guillain-Barre syndromeAIDS, whether from the disease or its treatment, syphilis, and kidney failureInherited disorders, such as amyloid polyneuropathy or Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseaseExposure to toxins, such as heavy metals, gold compounds, lead, arsenic, mercury, and organophosphate pesticidesCancer therapy drugs such as vincristine (Oncovin and Vincasar) and other medications, such as antibiotics including metronidazole (Flagyl) and isoniazidRarely, diseases such as neurofibromatosis can lead to peripheral neuropathy. Other rare congenital neuropathies include Fabry disease, Tangier disease, hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy, and hereditary amyloidosis.Statin medications have been linked to peripheral neuropathy, although neuropathy caused by statins only rarely causes symptoms.While diabetes and postherpetic neuralgia are the most common causes of peripheral neuropathy, oftentimes no cause is found. In these situations, it is referred to as idiopathic peripheral neuropathy.Sometimes, peripheral nerve entrapments, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, are considered peripheral neuropathies. In these cases, pressure on the nerve rather than a disease state leads to nerve malfunction.\nLatest Neurology News\nFDA OKs First Nasal Spray for Seizure Clusters\nThe Best Exercises for Brain Health\nBrief EMS Training Saves Lives After Brain Injury\nCan Medical Marijuana Help Kids With Autism?\nNew Treatment Focuses on Tourette Syndrome\nWant More News?

Usually, peripheral neuropathy affects the nerves of sensation. As a result, people with peripheral neuropathy develop pain, burning, or tingling in the distribution of the affected nerves. Most commonly, this is in the feet and/or hands. This can cause tingling, numbness, and/or burning in the toes or fingers.When shingles causes peripheral neuropathy, the particular nerve affected causes a localized burning and itching sensation, for example, in the side of the chest, the face, the buttock, etc.What tests diagnose peripheral neuropathy?\nBecause peripheral neuropathy has so many causes and so many presentations, the first step to diagnosis is performing a thorough medical history and physical examination. Certain tests done during the physical exam, including vibration and monofilament testing, are very accurate in diagnosing certain types of peripheral neuropathy, such as large fiber peripheral neuropathy seen with diabetes. Blood tests for exposure to toxins and electrodiagnostic studies, such as nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) are also very useful, although these tests will not help with the diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy. Either skin biopsies or quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (QSART) are occasionally used to help diagnose small fiber neuropathy.\nQUESTION\nWhat is diabetic peripheral neuropathy?\nSee Answer\nWhat is the treatment for peripheral neuropathy and its symptoms? Can peripheral neuropathy be cured?\nThe treatment for peripheral neuropathy depends on its cause. The first step in treatment is, therefore, to look for the cause.Vitamin deficiencies can be corrected.Diabetes can be controlled, although control may not reverse the neuropathy. The goal with diabetes is early detection and adequate treatment to prevent the occurrence of neuropathy.Neuropathies that are associated with immune diseases can improve with treatment of the autoimmune disease.Neuropathy caused by nerve entrapment can be treated by physical therapy, injections, or surgery.Prompt treatment with sympathetic injections can minimize the chance of shingles progressing to postherpetic neuralgia.If a specific treatment isn\'t available, the pain of the neuropathy can usually be controlled with medications. The simplest treatment is over-the-counter (OTC) medications, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil) or nortriptyline (Pamelor) and anti-seizure medications, such as carbamazepine (Tegretol) have been used to relieve the pain of neuropathy. Capsaicin, the chemical responsible for chili peppers being hot, is available over-the-counter as a cream to help relieve the pain of peripheral neuropathy. A prescription patch of 8% capsaicin (Qutenza) is approved for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. Pregabalin (Lyrica) is a medication that is used for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, while duloxetine (Cymbalta) has been approved for use in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In some instances, opioids can be used to help control the pain that can be associated with peripheral neuropathy.Both Vitamin B6 and alpha-lipoic acid have been used for relief in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.There is ongoing research into treatments for peripheral neuropathy, ranging from evaluating the effectiveness of topical gels to bone marrow treatments. As this research progresses, new therapies will become available.Individuals who believe that they have peripheral neuropathy should contact their health care professional since many causes of peripheral neuropathy can be successfully treated.Can peripheral neuropathy be prevented?\nCertain forms of peripheral neuropathy can be prevented. For example, avoiding alcohol toxicity, getting shingles vaccinations, avoiding heavy metal toxicity, and aggressively treating diabetes are all measures that can help prevent the development of peripheral neuropathy resulting from these causes.\nSubscribe to MedicineNet\'s Diabetes Newsletter\nBy clicking ""Submit,"" I agree to the MedicineNet Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\nI also agree to receive emails from MedicineNet and I understand that I may opt out of MedicineNet subscriptions at any time.\nHealth Solutions From Our Sponsors\nPenis Curved When Erect\nMS Tips\nOpioid Addiction\nPediatric Hospital 101\nHolistic Cancer Care\nAnswers for Infant Reflux\nMedically Reviewed on 9/11/2019\nReferences\nREFERENCE:Rutkove, SB, MD.

What are the uses for cefuroxime?\nWhat are the side effects of cefuroxime?\nWhat is the dosage for cefuroxime?\nWhich drugs or supplements interact with cefuroxime?\nIs cefuroxime safe to take while pregnant or breastfeeding?\nWhat else should I know about cefuroxime?\nWhat is cefuroxime? What are the uses for cefuroxime?\nCefuroxime is a semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, chemically similar to penicillin. Cephalosporins stop or slow the growth of bacterial cells by preventing bacteria from forming the cell wall that surrounds each cell. The cell wall protects bacteria from the external environment and keeps the contents of the cell together. Without a cell wall, bacteria are not able to survive. Cefuroxime is effective against a wide variety of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, E. coli, N. gonorrhea, and many others. Cefuroxime is used to treat infections of the middle ear, sinuses, skin, tonsils, and throat, and to treat laryngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, COPD, and early Lyme disease. The FDA approved cefuroxime in December 1987.What brand names are available for cefuroxime?Ceftin, ZinacefIs cefuroxime available as a generic drug?GENERIC AVAILABLE: YesDo I need a prescription for cefuroxime?Yes\nWhat are the side effects of cefuroxime?\nCefuroxime is generally well tolerated, and side effects are usually transient. Commonly reported side effects are:diarrhea,nausea,vomiting,abdominal pain,headache,rash,hives,vaginitis, andmouth ulcers.Other important side effects include:Allergic reactions,severe skin reactions,anemia, andseizures.Since cefuroxime is chemically related to penicillin, patients allergic to penicillin may develop an allergic reaction (sometimes even anaphylaxis) to cefuroxime. Cefuroxime like other antibiotics can alter the colon\'s normal bacteria, leading to overgrowth of a bacterium called\nClostridium difficile. Overgrowth of this bacterium leads to the release of toxins that contribute to the development of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, which may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal pseudomembranous colitis.What is the dosage for cefuroxime?\nTypical adult oral doses are 250 or 500 mg twice daily for 7-20 days depending on the type and severity of the infection. A single 1000 mg dose may be used for uncomplicated gonorrhea. The tablets and suspension are not interchangeable.\nQUESTION\nCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is the same as adult-onset asthma.\nSee Answer\nWhich drugs or supplements interact with cefuroxime?\nProbenecid increases the concentration of cefuroxime in the blood. Drugs that reduce acidity in the stomach (for example, antacids, H2-blockers, proton pump inhibitors) may reduce absorption of cefuroxime.Is cefuroxime safe to take while pregnant or breastfeeding?\nCephalosporins are usually considered safe for use during pregnancy.Cefuroxime is excreted in breast milk and may cause adverse effects in the infant. Cefuroxime is approved for pediatric patients 3 months and older.What else should I know about cefuroxime?\nWhat preparations of cefuroxime are available?Tablets: 125, 250 and 500 mg.Powder for Oral Suspension: 125 or 250 mg per 5 ml (teaspoon).Injection: 750 mg, 1.5 g and 7.5 g.How should I keep cefuroxime stored?Tablets should be stored at room temperature between 15 C - 30 C (59 F - 86 F).The oral suspension should be stored between 2 C - 30 C (36 F - 86 F) prior to mixing and refrigerated between 2 C - 8 C (36 F - 46 F) after mixing. The suspension should be discarded after 10 days.\nLatest Medications News\nHospitals Plan to Produce Their Own Generic Drugs\nPot Compound Alters Levels of Seizure Drug\nBriviact Approved for Epileptic Seizures\nDoctors\' Group Urges Greater Use of Generic Drugs\nNinlaro Approved for Multiple Myeloma\nWant More News?

But for active duty members of the military, staying healthy and physically fit is not just important for your life\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s part of your job.\nSo you exercise, eat well, and prioritize your physical health. Hopefully you\xe2\x80\x99re mindful about you mental health and relationships as well. But what about your sexual health?\nYou may know this, but they are all related. Sexual health is an important part of your overall wellbeing\xe2\x80\x94it has an impact on your physical, mental and emotional health. Taking care of your sexual health can prevent possibly serious health problems\xe2\x80\x94affecting your life and you ability to serve. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to make sexual health care part of your regular healthcare routine.\nClick to download the fact sheet\nBeing Sexually Healthy\nWhat does it mean to be sexually healthy? It means keeping your body as\xc2\xa0healthy as possible, having a satisfying sex life, and maintaining positive relationships. It means avoiding sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancies. It also means having access to the information and services\xc2\xa0you need to make this possible.\nFortunately, as a member of the military, you have services available to you, including STI testing at military treatment facilities, as well as confidential treatment and counseling, as needed. You have access to vaccinations that can prevent infection, contraceptive options, and medication to help prevent HIV.\nSteps to Take\nThere are specific, concrete actions you can take to help protect your sexual health and future fertility. (Yes\xe2\x80\x94fertility. Some STIs, like chlamydia, gonorrhea, and MGen, can cause health complications if undiagnosed and untreated and potentially affect your ability to have children in the future.) So take a tactical approach and follow the steps to better sexual health:\nStart with yourself.\nBefore sex, you need to think about your boundaries\xe2\x80\x94like what types of sexual activity you\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable with, your choices about STI and pregnancy prevention\xe2\x80\x94and talk about these boundaries with any sexual partner partner. This is crucial in make sure you are engaging in consensual sex. One important part of consent is making sure you are abiding by your partner\xe2\x80\x99s comfort level in protecting against STIs, birth control, and sexual acts\xe2\x80\x94and your partner is respecting yours.\nReduce Your Risk.\nSex is great, but also comes with some risk. This includes STIs and unintended pregnancy. The best way to prevent both at once is condoms. These can be internal or external condoms. Your choice. Another choice\xe2\x80\x94contraception. For women in the military, reducing the risk of an unintended pregnancy can be vital, as pregnancy can sideline acareer. There are highly effective contraceptive options available that provide years of pregnancy protection and require nothing on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s part. These are called LARC (long acting reversible contraceptive) methods and don\xe2\x80\x99t prevent a woman from having children in the future.\nGet tested regularly.\nSome people thing STI testing is only about finding STIs, not preventing them. But regular screening can help prevent someone from passing an STI to a partner. And since sometimes STIs will have no noticeable symptoms, getting tested is the only way to know. Service members are fortunate that they are periodically screened for some STIs, including HIV. But you may need to be screened more often. Learn what tests are recommended here. But basically\xe2\x80\x94have you had sex (vaginal, oral or anal) without a condom? Have a new partner? Multiple partners? Get tested. Ask you partner to get tested. And get treated, if needed.\nGet vaccinated.\nThere are three vaccines that can protect against viruses that can be sexually transmitted\xe2\x80\x94hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and HPV. Most members of the military receive recommended vaccines during basic training and before deployment, and you may already received these vaccines. But maybe not, so check. HPV is particular is a very common infection\xe2\x80\x94about 80% of sexually active people will have HPV at some point. And HPV is thought to cause nearly 35,000 cases of cancer each year. So vaccination is cancer prevention.\nResources for Service Members\nCheck out these resources, both from the military and other sources, to find reliable information on sexual health and STI prevention.\nNavy & Marine Corps Sexual Health and Responsibility Program (SHARP)\nA comprehensive list of resources for service members on such topics as STI and HIV prevention services, transgender health, contraception, and more.\nArmy Public Health: HIV and STD Prevention\nOffers a range of resources on STI and HIV prevention.\nArmy Public Health: Sexual Health for Women\nIncludes information on contraception, menstruation, and reproductive health, as well as common vaginal infections.\nGay and Bisexual Men\xe2\x80\x99s Sexual Health\nResources and information for gay and bisexual men and transgender women from SHARP.\nLesbian\xe2\x80\x99s and Bisexual Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health\nResources and information on lesbian and bisexual women\xe2\x80\x99s health from SHARP.\nTop Ten Questions for LGBTQ Patients to Discuss with a Healthcare Provider\nGLMA, a national organization committed to ensuring health equity for LGBTQ and all sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals, offers this resource addrrssing the unique health needs and concerns of LGBTQ patients.\nTRICARE\nHealth insurance for service members and their families.\nNational Sexual Health Coalition\nNot military-specific, but a great resource for taking charge of your sexual health.

Educating a child about sexual health is an important part of his or her healthy development. Their early understanding of sex, love, intimacy and their own sexuality can help mold their values, behavior, and even their self-image, for a lifetime.\nBe an Askable Parent\nDoes your child feel it\xe2\x80\x99s ok to talk with you about sex and sexual health? If not, have you thought about who will answer your child\xe2\x80\x99s questions? Only you can tell your child that it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to ask you questions. You want to become askable! After all, you are your child\xe2\x80\x99s first and most important teacher. Loving and caring parents actively discover a child\xe2\x80\x99s needs for information and then find ways to fill those needs. Even adolescents in their mid-teens are still learning from you.\nHere are some traits of an askable parent. Which phrases describe you?\nAn askable parent:\nShows respect, value, and love for children.\nRealizes that every difficult situation is not a crisis.\nWants communication, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to have all the answers.\nKnows the most important part of communication is listening.\nDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh when a child asks a question, even in reaction to the child\xe2\x80\x99s cuteness.\nDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to be perfect, and knows that admitting mistakes is a valuable lesson for the child.\nIs sometimes embarrassed by questions about sex but acknowledges the discomfort and explains it to the child.\nChildren are more likely to talk to an approachable parent. If you think the traits above describe you, then you are very askable.\nContinue to Learn\nWhile talking to your child about sex and sexual health is important, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily easy for every parent. You may feel uncomfortable with the subject. But if you do, say so\xe2\x80\x93you child will appreciate your honesty and your admission may even serve as an ice-breaker. Remember, talking about sex should be an ongoing conversation between you and your child, not an endurance contest for both of you trying to get through \xe2\x80\x9cthe talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhat if I don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the answers?\nThen you\xe2\x80\x99re like everyone else! It might be helpful to prepare by doing a little homework before you talk to your child. Reach out to others for information, understanding, and ideas on how to maintain open communication with your child. Support from others parents, family members, teachers, members of the clergy, and healthcare providers can help you and your child learn to talk about sexual health, a lifelong subject. See the resources section below for more.\nBe prepared\nParents who are uncomfortable talking about sexual health may find it helpful to plan what they will say and how they might answer their child\xe2\x80\x99s questions. When your child asks a question or does something that triggers a teachable moment, first make sure you know what the child is asking. Ask your child, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean\xe2\x80\xa6?\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdo you want to know about\xe2\x80\xa6?\xe2\x80\x9d After you\xe2\x80\x99ve decided what to say, keep it short, simple and age appropriate\xe2\x80\x93you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to offer more information than you child wants or needs to know.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s equally important to prepare your emotional responses. It may be difficult to think of your child as a sexual being or to present yourself as one. Still, you know your child best and that puts you in the best position to answer his or her questions, resolve any confusion and share your feelings. Open communication and accurate information from you can help your child understand the impact of sexual activity, the benefit of waiting to have sex and the reasons why practicing safer sex is vital when he or she decides to become sexually active.\nFor additional information on becoming an Askable Parent, check out ASHA\xe2\x80\x99s award-winning publication.\nPrimary Sidebar#YESMEANSTEST\nDo It For Your Country!\nExpress Yourself\nIn the News\nSexually Transmitted Disease SurveillanceSweet Harmony: ACIP Updates HPV Vaccine Recommendations for Males and FemalesDesperate Housewives Star Talks about her Anal Cancer DiagnosisAccess Denied:\nAbortion Rights ThreatenedFDA Approves HPV Vaccine for Adults Over 26\nConnect with ASHA\nGet Involved\nTune In\nConnect with ASHA\nSecondary SidebarParents\nHow to Talk to Your Kids\nStart the Conversation\nHPV Vaccine: Protect Yourself and Your Kids\nSelf-Assessment Tool for Young Male and Female Patients\nResources for Parents\nFooter Site Use and Privacy\nOnline Support Community\nSexual Health Glossary\nLinks to other sites\nContact Us\nContact Us\nASHA\nPO Box 13827\nResearch Triangle Park, NC 27709\n919.361.8400\ninfo@ashasexualhealth.org\nSearch this site\nSearch this website\nCopyright \xc2\xa9\xc2\xa02020 \xc2\xb7 American Sexual Health Association'"

It is the virus that causes AIDS. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. HIV can be transmitted through the blood, sexual fluids, or breast milk of an HIV-infected person.\nOver time, infection with HIV can weaken the immune system to the point that the system has difficulty fighting off certain infections. These types of infections are known as opportunistic infections. These infections are usually controlled by a healthy immune system, but they can cause problems or even be life-threatening in someone with AIDS.\nA blood test can determine if a person is infected with HIV. Too many people don\xe2\x80\x99t know they have HIV. In the United States, nearly 1.1 million people are living with HIV, and almost one in five don\xe2\x80\x99t know they are infected. Getting tested is the first step to finding out if you have HIV. If you have HIV, getting medical care and taking medicines regularly helps you live a longer, healthier life and also lowers the chances of passing HIV on to others.\nIf a person tests positive for HIV, it does not necessarily mean that the person has AIDS. A diagnosis of AIDS is made by a physician according to the CDC AIDS Case Definition. A person infected with HIV may receive an AIDS diagnosis after developing one of the CDC-defined AIDS indicator illnesses. A person with HIV can also receive an AIDS diagnosis on the basis of certain blood tests (CD4 counts) and may not have experienced any serious illnesses.\nFAQs\nWhere did HIV come from?There are many theories about the origin of HIV. The first known case was found in a blood sample collected from man from Kinshasha, Democratic Republic of Congo in 1959. Genetic analysis of this blood suggests that the origin of HIV came from a single strain of HIV-1 in the 1940s or 1950s. In the U.S. the virus is known to have existed since the mid 1970s. Symptoms of rare types of what are now known as opportunistic infections began manifesting themselves between 1979-1981. HIV was first isolated by scientists in 1983. The virus was at first called HTLV-III/LAV (human T-cell lymphotropic virus-type III/lymphadenopathy- associated virus) by an international scientific committee. This name was later changed to HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).\nWhat is AIDS?A diagnosis of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is made by a physician. An HIV-infected person may be diagnosed with AIDS if he or she meets certain clinical criteria. Criteria include becoming sick with an illness defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as an AIDS-indicator illness (illnesses that take advantage of the body\xe2\x80\x99s weakened immune system) and/or by taking a blood test that shows that the person\xe2\x80\x99s immune system is severely damaged.\nWhat are the symptoms of HIV?Most people infected with HIV do not know that they have become infected, because they do not feel ill immediately after infection. However, some people do experience a illness with fever, rash, joint pains and enlarged lymph nodes. If an immune reaction to HIV occurs, it usually takes place between 1 and 6 weeks after HIV infection has happened. A person with HIV may look healthy and feel good, but they can still pass the virus to you, especially during the initial infection period. You cannot tell if someone has HIV by just looking at them. The only way to determine whether HIV is present in a person\xe2\x80\x99s body is by testing.\nHow does HIV become AIDS?AIDS is a disease caused by HIV. HIV infects cells of the human immune system and destroys or impairs their function. Infection with this virus leads to slow destruction of a persons\xe2\x80\x99 immune system making them more susceptible to many kinds of infections. Once a person with HIV develops any one of a number of rare infections or cancers \xe2\x80\x93 tuberculosis, pneumonia, candidiases or tumors \xe2\x80\x93 they are said to have AIDS. This most often occurs 10-15 years after a person becomes infected with HIV.\nHow long does it take for HIV to cause AIDS?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), prior to 1996, scientists estimated that about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years after becoming infected. This time varied greatly from person to person and depended on many factors, including a person\xe2\x80\x99s health status and their health-related behaviors.\nSince 1996, the introduction of powerful anti-retroviral therapies has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. There are also other medical treatments that can prevent or cure some of the illnesses associated with AIDS, though the treatments do not cure AIDS itself. Because of these advances in drug therapies and other medical treatments, estimates of how many people will develop AIDS and how soon are being recalculated, revised, or are currently under study.\nHow common are HIV and AIDS?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 1 million persons in the United States are living with diagnosed or undiagnosed HIV/AIDS. CDC estimates there are over 41,000 new HIV infections in the United States each year.\nThe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that, since the beginning of the epidemic, almost 60 million people worldwide have been infected with HIV and 25 million people have died of HIV-related causes. UNAIDS estimates that about 33.4 million people worldwide were living with HIV in 2008.\nWho does HIV affect?There are various risk factors that make some people more at risk for contracting HIV than others. Most people, however, run some risk of contracting HIV as they share in one or more of the following risk factors:\nUnprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex\nEarly age of first sexual activity\xe2\x80\x94It is common for youth to engage in sexual activity before receiving information about HIV prevention\nHeterosexual sex\xe2\x80\x93Women and minorities are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection\nMen who have Sex with Men (MSM)\xe2\x80\x93Stigma and discrimination make it more difficult for MSM to access testing and counseling services\nSexually transmitted infection (STIs)\xe2\x80\x93The presence of other STIs can greatly increase the likelihood of HIV transmission\nUnprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex\nExchange sex for money\nSubstance abuse\xe2\x80\x94Chronic and intermittent substance users are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors while using. Injection drug users also run the risk of being infected by HIV while sharing unclean needles.\nPoverty\xe2\x80\x94Socioeconomic factors can directly and indirectly influence a person\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerability to HIV infection. For many people poverty prevents access to quality health care.\nOut-of-school youth\xe2\x80\x94Those that drop out of school are more likely to become sexually active younger and less likely to use condoms and other types of contraception.\nLack of awareness\xe2\x80\x94Many people, particularly youth, don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize the ways in which they are vulnerable to HIV infection, making them more likely to behave in ways that put them at risk.\nHow safe is the U.S. blood supply?The U.S. blood supply is one of the safest in the world. Infection through blood transfusion and other blood products is rare. Since 1985, the blood supply has been ELISA tested for HIV. According to the CDC, an estimated 1 in 450,000 to 1 in 660,000 donations per year are infectious for HIV but are not detected by current antibody screening tests. In 1995, blood banks also began testing with P24 tests along with ELISA, to detect infection with HIV during this window period. As technology advances, the blood supply will become even safer.\nHow is HIV transmitted?HIV can be transmitted through the blood, sexual fluids (semen, preseminal fluid, or vaginal fluid) or breast milk of an HIV-infected person. People can get HIV one of these fluids enters the body by way of the mucous membranes (the soft, moist skin found in any opening of the body) or the bloodstream. The virus can be passed during unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex with a HIV-infected person. An HIV-infected mother can transmit HIV to her infant during pregnancy, delivery or while breastfeeding. People can also become infected with HIV when using injection drugs through sharing needles and other equipment (or works) including cookers and cottons with someone who is infected.\nThe risk of transmission varies with the type of exposure (e.g. sexual, needle sharing, etc.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a table quantifying the this HIV transmission risk that comes from different types of exposures. See the table and explanation at the CDC website.\nHow effective are latex condoms at preventing HIV?Studies have been done to test how well latex condoms work for preventing HIV transmission. This research has shown that latex condoms are highly effective at protecting a person from transmitting or becoming infected with the virus. The studies were done on HIV-negative individuals at high-risk for the disease because there partners were HIV-positive. Latex condoms used consistently and correctly were effective 98-100% of the time.\nWhile not having sex or to having sex with a long-term mutually monogamous partner who is not infected with HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is the only way to protect yourself completely, latex condoms used consistently and correctly are highly effective in preventing HIV and many other STIs.\nCan I get HIV from casual contact? HIV is not transmitted by day-to-day contact in social settings, schools or in the workplace. You cannot be infected by shaking someone\xe2\x80\x99s hand, by hugging someone, by using the same toilet or drinking from the same glass as an HIV-positive person, playing sports with or by being exposed to coughing or sneezing by anyone living with HIV. There is no evidence that HIV is spread through kissing. So you should not be fearful of interacting with persons who are living with the disease.\nPrimary SidebarGet Help\nGet Involved\nExpress Yourself\nConnect with ASHA\nTune In\nYes Means Test\nFooter Site Use and Privacy\nOnline Support Community\nSexual Health Glossary\nLinks to other sites\nContact Us\nContact Us\nASHA\nPO Box 13827\nResearch Triangle Park, NC 27709\n919.361.8400\ninfo@ashasexualhealth.org\nSearch this site\nSearch this website\nCopyright \xc2\xa9\xc2\xa02020 \xc2\xb7 American Sexual Health Association'"

It is sent to a lab for testing. A biopsy is performed in a hospital or a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office. Your doctor will tell you how to prepare for a biopsy. A biopsy helps examine tissue or a growth, or diagnose a disease. Sometimes, it is used to find a treatment for your disease or see if you are a match for an organ transplant.\nTypes of biopsies\nThere are two common types of biopsy: needle and skin. Your biopsy type will depend on why you are having it done. Your doctor will call you with the lab results.\nA needle biopsy involves inserting a needle through your skin and into the area your doctor is examining. There are several types of needle biopsies:\nA fine-needle aspiration is a thin needle attached to a syringe. It is a simple way to remove a small sample of fluid or tissue.\nA core needle (a larger, hollow needle) is used to remove a larger sample. This method is commonly used in breast biopsies to check for breast cancer.\nImage-guided biopsies are performed with the help of an X-ray, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), a CT scan (CAT scan), ultrasound machine, or mammogram technology. These technologies help guide the needle to the tissue or growth.\nAn open biopsy is a surgical procedure and requires local or general anesthesia. Local anesthesia relaxes or sedates you. General anesthesia is given to you through an IV (intravenous) injection in a vein in your arm. It prevents pain during the biopsy and puts you into a deep sleep. This is always done in a hospital or surgical center.\nLaparoscopic biopsies rely on a small surgical incision to insert a flexible tube attached to a camera and needle or thin wire. This helps direct the doctor to the right spot for the biopsy. Sometimes, a thin wire is used to remove the tissue the doctor needs to test.\nA skin biopsy is generally performed on the surface of your skin. There are four types of skin biopsies: shave (or scrape), punch, excisional, and incisional. A skin biopsy is often used to examine an abnormal looking skin growth or lesion (sore). Your doctor will likely numb the area around the biopsy site by injecting a local anesthesia just under your skin. Your doctor may also choose to freeze the surface with a topical numbing medicine.\nA shave biopsy uses a razor or small blade to scrape away a part of a skin growth or sore. It\xe2\x80\x99s a method that is commonly used on moles if your doctor is testing for skin cancer. You will not need anesthesia or stitches.\nA punch biopsy uses a special device to remove all or nearly all of a suspicious skin lesion. The procedure cuts deeper into the skin. You may have to have stitches. It\xe2\x80\x99s a method generally used to examine a rash.\nExcisional biopsy involves using a small scalpel (surgical knife). It\xe2\x80\x99s a method typically used to remove the entire lesion. It will require stitches and local anesthesia for pain.\nIncisional biopsy is generally used on very large lesions. Your doctor will remove just a part of the lesion to test or treat it. You will need stitches and a local anesthesia for pain.\nIf you have a skin cancer on your eyelids, nose, ears, lips or hands, your doctor may do a Mohs biopsy. Mohs protects the healthy skin around the cancer. Your doctor will cut a little of the cancer at a time. He or she will examine it under a microscope while you wait on the procedure table. Your doctor will cut more of the growth until he or she no longer sees cancer in the outer borders.\nYou may experience brief pain for all biopsies (because of the procedure or the anesthesia injection). Your recovery time from the procedure is based on the type of biopsy you had. Also, it depends on whether or not you needed local or general anesthesia during the procedure, how large the area being biopsied was, and where the biopsy was taken from. Recovery also will depend on whether or not you needed stitches.\nThings to consider\nBefore your biopsy, tell your doctor if you are pregnant, are allergic to latex (rubber gloves), and about any medicines, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking. Certain medicines act as blood thinners, which makes it difficult to stop bleeding.\nWith all biopsies, there is a risk of infection, bleeding, and scarring.

In the procedure, a doctor cuts open the body and looks at the organs. He or she takes samples and looks at them under a microscope. What the doctor finds can answer many questions. Autopsies are done for several reasons:\nTo answer questions about a person\xe2\x80\x99s illness.\nTo tell how and why the person died.\nFor education and research.\nTo assist in legal cases.\nSpecially trained doctors, called pathologists, perform autopsies. Pathologists are experts in looking at body tissues and fluids.\nWho may request an autopsy?\nYou can request an autopsy if you are the person\xe2\x80\x99s next of kin or the legally responsible party. You will need to sign a consent form to give permission for the autopsy. Reasons you may ask for an autopsy include:\nDoctors can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you why the person died.\nThe death occurred without warning during medical treatment.\nThere could be genetic problems that other family members could be at risk for.\nThe cause of death could have an impact on legal matters.\nYou may limit the autopsy in any manner you wish. For example, you can restrict it to a specific organ or area of the body.\nA medical examiner can order an autopsy without the family\xe2\x80\x99s permission. This can happen if the cause of death is unclear or suspicious.\nWhat is the procedure for an autopsy?\nFirst, the pathologist looks at the outside of the body. He or she looks for clues about the cause of death. Next, they examine the internal organs. They cut a Y or U shape into the chest and down the abdomen. They look at the organs. They take samples as needed to look at under a microscope. They may remove the organs completely to examine them.\nThey may also run toxicology or other lab tests. These tests check for drugs or chemicals in the blood, urine or saliva. When they are finished observing and testing, everything is returned to the body. Then the body is sewn up. Sometimes the organs are kept for teaching and research.\nThe autopsy takes from 2 to 4 hours. The autopsy room looks similar to an operating room. An atmosphere of dignity and respect for the deceased is maintained at all times.\nWhen will the results of an autopsy be known?\nThe first findings from an autopsy are usually ready in 2 to 3 days. The doctor can review these results with you. Detailed studies are then performed on\xc2\xa0tissue\xc2\xa0samples. This could take up to many weeks. A final report will be written. The doctor will also review this report with you, as well.\nWhat does an autopsy cost?\nAutopsies help doctors learn more about illness and ways to improve medical care. So some are performed without charge. These can include those done at the hospital where the person died. Some teaching hospitals also will do autopsies at no charge, even if the person died somewhere else. But many hospitals do charge for autopsies. Make sure you understand what the charges are before you request the procedure. You do not have to pay for an autopsy if it is required by law.\nSome private pathologists offer their services through newspapers, funeral homes, or online. You would also have to pay for their services. It is unknown whether they are as objective and trustworthy as a general hospital or academic medical center.\nThings to consider\nSome people are afraid an autopsy will interfere with the funeral. This is not the case. The procedure can be completed in just a few hours. Once the autopsy is completed, the hospital tells the funeral home. So it does not delay funeral services. In addition, the incisions are not visible once the body has been embalmed and prepared by the mortician. So you can still have an open casket funeral after an autopsy.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nShould my loved one have an autopsy?\nWhat will the pathologist look for?\nHow long will it take to get the results?\nWill it disfigure my loved one?\nWho do I contact if I want to donate his or her organs to science?\nLast Updated: October 6, 2017\nThis article was contributed by familydoctor.org editorial staff.\nCategories: Healthcare Management, Your Health ResourcesTags: autopsy, Autopsy: Questions and Answers September 1, 2000\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

The procedure takes only about 5 to 20 minutes. Using a local anesthetic (medicine that numbs only a small, specific part of the body) makes the procedure less painful. The anesthetic may be given as an injection or applied as a cream. A doctor will perform the circumcision in a hospital or outpatient office, or it can be done at home by a hired professional as part of a religious or cultural ceremony.\nCircumcision is usually performed during the first 10 days after birth if the baby is stable and healthy. Often, it is done the first or second day after birth. Circumcision is riskier and more complicated in infants older than 2 months of age, and in older boys and men.\nRelated TopicsNewborn Reflexes and BehaviorRead Article >>Newborn Reflexes and Behavior Newborn Sleep RoutinesRead Article >>Newborn Sleep Routines Bonding with BabyRead Article >>Bonding with Baby\nHow do I decide whether to have my son circumcised?\nDeciding whether to have your newborn son circumcised may be difficult. You will need to consider the benefits and the risks of circumcision. Factors such as your culture, religion, and personal preferences may also affect your decision. It is a good idea to decide before your son is born whether you want him to be circumcised.\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends that parents talk to their family doctor about the potential benefits and risks of circumcision when making their decision.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says the health benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks. However, the AAP does not think the benefits are great enough to recommend that all male newborns should be circumcised.\nPath to Improved Health\nStudies have shown some limited health benefits of circumcision. It offers some limited benefit in preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in infants. Overall, UTIs are not common in circumcised or uncircumcised males. Newborn circumcision also offers some benefit in preventing cancer of the penis in adulthood. However, this cancer is rare in all men, whether or not they have been circumcised. Circumcision may reduce the risk of certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Know that preventing STIs has more to do with a man\xe2\x80\x99s sexual practices (for example, using condoms, limiting the number of sex partners) than with whether or not he is circumcised.\nHow do I care for my baby\xe2\x80\x99s penis after circumcision?\nIt normally takes about 7 to 10 days for the penis to heal after a circumcision. Some swelling of the penis is normal. It is also normal for a yellow discharge or coating to form over the tip of the penis. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to take this off. It will go away on its own. Gently clean the area with water every day, whenever your baby needs a fresh diaper. Use mild soap and water to clean stool off of the penis. This will help prevent infection.\nIf there is a bandage on the penis after circumcision, the bandage will probably fall off the next time your baby urinates. Ask your doctor whether you should leave the bandage off or if you should put on a new bandage each time you change your son\xe2\x80\x99s diaper.\nSometimes, your baby\xe2\x80\x99s urine and the pressure from his diaper will irritate the newly exposed skin on the tip of the penis. This can be treated by putting petroleum ointment (such as Vaseline) directly on the area. It will usually get better after a few days.\nHow do I care for my baby\xe2\x80\x99s penis if I choose not to have him circumcised?\nKeeping the penis clean with soap and water helps reduce the risk of problems or infections. When your son gets older, his foreskin will separate from the tip of his penis. This is called retraction. It happens at different times for different boys. Most boys can retract their foreskin by the time they are 5 years of age. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to force the foreskin to retract before it is ready. This can damage the penis and cause pain and other problems. Once the foreskin is ready to retract, you can teach your son how to gently pull the foreskin back and clean the skin underneath. He should wash beneath his foreskin every day while bathing or showering.\nThings to Consider\nLike any surgical procedure, circumcision does have some risks. However, the rate of problems after circumcision is quite low. Bleeding and infection in the circumcised area are the most common problems. Both of these can be treated by your doctor.\nWhen to call your doctor\nAfter the circumcision, you may notice a small amount of blood on your baby\xe2\x80\x99s diaper. If the bloodstain is larger than the size of a quarter, call your doctor right away. You should also call your doctor if:\nThe wound does not stop bleeding.\nYour baby does not have a wet diaper within 6 to 8 hours after the circumcision.\nRedness and swelling around the tip of the penis does not go away after 3 to 5 days, or it gets worse.\nThe yellow discharge or coating on the tip of the penis does not go away after 7 days.\nA Plastibell device was used and it does not fall off within 10 to 12 days.\nYour baby has a temperature of 100.4\xc2\xb0F or higher.\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor\nDo you plan to give the anesthetic as an injection or a cream?\nHow will I know if my baby\xe2\x80\x99s penis is infected?\nWhat soap do you recommend for washing the bandaged area?\nResources\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics: Circumcision Policy Statement\nLast Updated: April 22, 2019\nThis article was contributed by familydoctor.org editorial staff.\nCategories: Family Health, Infants and Toddlers, Pregnancy and ChildbirthTags: circumcision, newborn, newborns, uncircumcised November 2, 2016\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It is the only medical society devoted solely to primary care.\xc2\xa0Family physicians conduct approximately one in five office visits \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s 192 million visits annually or 48 percent more than the next most visited medical specialty. Today, family physicians provide more care for America\xe2\x80\x99s underserved and rural populations than any other medical specialty. Family medicine\xe2\x80\x99s cornerstone is an ongoing, personal patient-physician relationship focused on integrated care.\nAAFP Foundation\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians Foundation serves as the philanthropic arm of the\xc2\xa0American Academy of Family Physicians. Its mission is to advance the values of Family Medicine by promoting humanitarian, educational and scientific initiatives that improve the health of all people. The AAFP Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization and supports more than 20 programs each year.\nAbout Family Physicians\nFamily physicians are personal doctors for people of all ages and health conditions. They are a reliable first contact for health concerns and directly address most health care needs. Through enduring partnerships, family physicians help patients prevent, understand, and manage illness, navigate the health system and set health goals. Family physicians and their teams adapt their care to the unique needs of their patients and communities. They use data to monitor and manage their patient population, and use the best science available to prioritize services most likely to benefit health. They are ideal leaders of health care systems and partners for public health.\nWhy Primary Care?\nPrimary care can help put the health back in health care. A system based on primary care can help us deliver on the Triple Aim: better health, better care, and lower costs.\nBetter Health\nEvidence shows that access to primary care can help us live longer, healthier lives.\nStudies suggest that as many as 127,617 deaths per year in the United States could be averted through an increase in the number of primary care physicians.\nIn areas of the country where there are more primary care providers per person, death rates for cancer, heart disease, and stroke are lower and people are less likely to be hospitalized.\nLower Cost\nA primary care-based system may cost less because patients experience fewer hospitalizations, less duplication, and more appropriate technology.\nU.S. adults who have a primary care physician have 33 percent lower health care costs.\nMedicare spending is less for states with more primary care physicians and yet these states have more effective, higher-quality care.\nA health system that undervalues primary care has resulted in health care spending that is more than double that of other industrialized countries, yet America ranks 24th out of 30 in life expectancy.\nBetter Care\nUrban and rural communities that have an adequate supply of primary care doctors experience lower infant mortality, higher birth weights, and immunization rates at or above national standards despite social disparities.\nAn increase of 1 primary care doctor per 10,000 people can decrease costly and unnecessary care.\nEvidence shows that primary care (in contrast to specialty care) is associated with a more equitable distribution of heath in populations.\nAbout\nSupport Us\nSponsored Content Specifications\nEditorial Calendar\nEditorial Policy\nSponsored Content Guidelines\nAdvertising Guidelines\nCopyright & Permissions\nPrivacy Policy\nContact\nAbout\nSupport Us\nCopyright & Permissions\nPrivacy Policy\nContact\nfamilydoctor.org is powered by\n\xc2\xa9 2020 American Academy of Family Physicians\nsubmit site search\nDiseases and Conditions\nPrevention and Wellness\nStaying Healthy\nHealthy Living\nTravel\nOccupational Health\nFirst Aid and Injury Prevention\nCrisis Situations\nPets and Animals\nmyhealthfinder\nFood and Nutrition\nHealthy Food Choices\nWeight Loss and Diet Plans\nNutrients and Nutritional Info\nSugar and Sugar Substitutes\nExercise and Fitness\nExercise Basics\nSports Safety\nInjury Rehabilitation\nEmotional Well-Being\nMental Health\nSex and Birth Control\nSex and Sexuality\nBirth Control\nFamily Health\nInfants and Toddlers\nKids and Teens\nPregnancy and Childbirth\nWomen\nMen\nSeniors\nYour Health Resources\nHealthcare Management\nInsurance & Bills\nSelf Care\nWorking With Your Doctor\nDoctors\xe2\x80\x99 Notes\nDrugs, Procedures & Devices\nOver-the-counter Products\nProcedures & Devices\nPrescription Medicines\nHealth Tools\nDictionary\nSymptom Checker\nBMI Calculator\nmyhealthfinder\nNeighborhood Navigator\nImmunization Schedules\nNutrient Shortfall Questionnaire\nDiseases and Conditions\nPrevention and Wellness\nStaying Healthy\nHealthy Living\nTravel\nOccupational Health\nFirst Aid and Injury Prevention\nCrisis Situations\nPets and Animals\nmyhealthfinder\nFood and Nutrition\nHealthy Food Choices\nWeight Loss and Diet Plans\nNutrients and Nutritional Info\nSugar and Sugar Substitutes\nExercise and Fitness\nExercise Basics\nSports Safety\nInjury Rehabilitation\nEmotional Well-Being\nMental Health\nSex and Birth Control\nSex and Sexuality\nBirth Control\nFamily Health\nInfants and Toddlers\nKids and Teens\nPregnancy and Childbirth\nWomen\nMen\nSeniors\nYour Health Resources\nHealthcare Management\nInsurance & Bills\nSelf Care\nWorking With Your Doctor\nDoctors\xe2\x80\x99 Notes\nDrugs, Procedures & Devices\nOver-the-counter Products\nProcedures & Devices\nPrescription Medicines\nHealth Tools\nDictionary\nSymptom Checker\nBMI Calculator\nmyhealthfinder\nNeighborhood Navigator\nImmunization Schedules\nNutrient Shortfall Questionnaire\nVisit our interactive symptom checker\nVisit our interactive symptom checker Get Started\n<img height=""1"" width=""1"" style=""display:none"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=297209990620305&ev=PageView&noscript=1"" />\n<img height=""1"" width=""1"" style=""display:none""\nsrc=""https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=568027847384514&ev=PageView&noscript=1""\n/>'"

Overview2. Symptoms3. Causes4. Diagnosis5. Treatment6. Questions\nAdvertisement\nWhat is labyrinthitis?\nLabyrinthitis (say: \xe2\x80\x9clab-uh-rinth-eye-tus\xe2\x80\x9d) is a condition that affects a part of the inner ear called the labyrinth. Normally, the labyrinth helps you keep your balance. When it gets swollen, the labyrinth doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work properly so your brain doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get the right balance signals. Labyrinthitis can make you feel like you are falling or spinning, even though you aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\nWhat are the symptoms of labyrinthitis?\nSymptoms of labyrinthitis can range from mild to severe. You may have symptoms as soon as you wake up in the morning, or they may occur suddenly throughout the day. Common symptoms include the following:\nDizziness\nFeeling that you are spinning (also called vertigo)\nEye jerking (also called nystagmus)\nNausea or vomiting\nHearing loss in one ear\nRinging in your ears (also called tinnitus)\nIf you have symptoms of labyrinthitis, talk to your doctor. Other conditions that are more serious can cause similar symptoms. Get medical care right away if you experience vertigo with a fever above 101\xcb\x9aF, fainting, convulsions, slurred speech, paralysis, double vision or severe vomiting.\nWhat causes labyrinthitis?\nThe swelling in the inner ear that causes labyrinthitis often results from a viral or bacterial infection. For example, people often develop labyrinthitis after having an upper respiratory infection, such as the flu or a cold.\nHow can my doctor tell if I have labyrinthitis?\nYour doctor will ask questions about your symptoms and examine you. Your doctor may do some tests to be sure that another condition isn\xe2\x80\x99t causing your labyrinthitis.\nTreatment\nHow is labyrinthitis treated?\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (also called NSAIDs) are sometimes used to reduce swelling. These include ibuprofen (two brand names: Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (one brand name: Aleve). Steroid medicines are another option to reduce swelling. Your doctor may also prescribe medicine to relieve nausea, vomiting and dizziness. However, even without treatment, the symptoms of labyrinthitis will usually go away after several weeks.\nIf you have vomiting that is severe and uncontrollable, you may need to spend a short time in the hospital to prevent dehydration.\nWhat can I do to feel better?\nYou will probably need to take it easy for at least a week or two. During this time, avoid activities like driving, climbing or operating heavy equipment. Sudden dizziness can make these activities dangerous. Tips to help you feel better include the following:\nAvoid sudden movement, especially of your head.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t play sports that require lots of movement, such as racquetball or volleyball.\nLie still when you\xe2\x80\x99re having symptoms.\nAvoid bright lights.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t try to read when you\xe2\x80\x99re having symptoms.\nWhat can I expect during my recovery?\nYour most severe symptoms will probably get better after the first week. Most people are completely better within 2 to 3 months. Sensitivity to motion may be a problem for several years, especially for older adults. In rare cases, people may have permanent hearing loss. This is less likely if labyrinthitis is treated promptly.\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor\nWill I lose my hearing?\nIs there anything I can do to make the dizziness stop?\nWhen should I call the doctor?\nIf the dizziness gets really bad or I start throwing up, should I go to the emergency room?\nHow long could this last?\nIs there a medicine I could take to help with my symptoms?\nLast Updated: April 1, 2014\nThis article was contributed by: familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCategories: Family Health, MenTags: altitude sickness, dizziness, inner ear, labyrinthitis, nystagmus, purulent labyrinthitis\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Resources\nAdvertisement\nAn outbreak of the coronavirus (now called COVID-19) in China is causing global concern. It came from a seafood and meat market in Wuhan, China, in December. It has since spread to other countries, including the United States.\nDespite Wuhan and other Chinese cities being quarantined, the COVID-19 has spread to almost 70 locations internationally. In the U.S., COVID-19 cases have been confirmed and deaths have been reported.\nWhat is a coronavirus?\nA coronavirus is a virus that is found in animals and, rarely, can be transmitted from animals to humans and then spread person to person. In addition to COVID-19, other human coronaviruses have included:\nThe MERS virus, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.\nThe SARS virus, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which first occurred in the Guangdong province in southern China.\nWhat are the symptoms of a coronavirus?\nCOVID-19 symptoms range from mild to severe. It takes 2-14 days after exposure for symptoms to develop. Symptoms may include:\nfever\ncough\nshortness of breath\nThose with weakened immune systems may develop more serious symptoms, like pneumonia or bronchitis. You may never develop symptoms after being exposed to COVID-19. So far, most confirmed cases are in adults, but some children have been infected. There is no evidence that children are at greater risk for getting the virus.\nWhat causes a coronavirus infection?\nHumans first get a coronavirus from contact with animals. Then, it can spread from human to human. Health officials do not know what animal caused COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 virus can be spread through contact with certain bodily fluids, such as droplets in a cough. It might also be caused by touching something an infected person has touched and then touching your hand to your mouth, nose, or eyes.\nHow is a coronavirus diagnosed?\nIf you believe you have COVID-19, you should contact your family doctor immediately. Before going to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office, call with your concerns. This will allow the office to collect information and offer you guidance on next steps. To diagnose you, your doctor may run tests to rule out other common infections. In some cases, your doctor may suggest you self-isolate to prevent the spread of infection. The FDA has also seen unauthorized fraudulent test kits for COVID-19 being sold online. Currently, the only way to be tested for COVID-19 is to talk to your family doctor.\nCan a coronavirus be prevented or avoided?\nPractice social distancing. Avoid people who are sick or meeting in large groups. Stay home if you are sick. Cover your cough with a tissue or cough into your upper sleeve or elbow.\xc2\xa0 Do not cough into your hands.\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Avoid touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.\nCoronavirus treatment\nThere is currently no vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. Symptoms of a coronavirus usually go away on their own. If symptoms feel worse than a common cold, contact your doctor. He or she may prescribe pain or fever medication. The FDA is currently advising people to be cautious of websites and stores selling products that claim to prevent, treat or cure COVID-19. Additionally, do not take any form of chloroquine unless it has been prescribed for you by your family doctor and purchased from a legitimate source.\nAs with a cold or the flu, drink fluids and get plenty of rest. If you are having trouble breathing, seek immediate medical care.\nLiving with a coronavirus\nWhen possible, avoid contact with others when you are sick. If you have COVID-19, wear a facemask to prevent spreading the virus to others. The CDC does not recommend wearing a mask if you do not have COVID-19.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nWhat can I do to prevent my friends and family from getting the COVID-19?\nWhat over-the-counter medicines work best for my symptoms?\nAm I at risk of complications because of COVID-19?\nWhat should I watch for that could mean there are complications?\nRead More from Familydoctor.org\nKnow the Facts About COVID-19\nHandwashing and COVID-19\nHand Sanitizers and COVID-19\nTop 10 Tips From Your Family Doctor\nOther Resources\nAbout Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nLast Updated: March 26, 2020\nThis article was contributed by: familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCategories: Family HealthTags: fever, flu\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Melatonin helps regulate your sleep cycle. It tells your body when it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go to sleep and when it\xe2\x80\x99s time to wake up.\nMelatonin is available as a supplement in pill form. There are two types: natural and synthetic (manmade). Natural melatonin is made from the pineal gland of animals. This form could be contaminated with a virus so it is not recommended. The synthetic form of melatonin does not carry this risk. The label on the pill bottle should list the type. If you are not sure, ask a pharmacist or doctor before you take it.\nMelatonin is sold over the counter (OTC) in health food stores and drug stores in the United States. Like other dietary supplements, it is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, it is not approved for certain uses. Because of this, its purity, safety, and success cannot be guaranteed.\nPath to improved health\nMost people take melatonin to help treat sleep disorders. The most common one is insomnia, which is difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep. You also can take it to help prevent or treat jet lag. The typical adult dose ranges from 0.3 mg to 5 mg at bedtime. Lower doses often work as well as higher doses.\nRead the directions on the label of the pill bottle. These will tell you how much melatonin to take and how often to take it. If you have questions about how to take melatonin, call your doctor or pharmacist. Do not take more than the recommended amount. Taking more melatonin does not make it work quicker or better. Overdosing on any medicine can be dangerous.\nKeep a record of all medicines and supplements you take and when you take them. Take this list with you when you go to the doctor. Ask your doctor if it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to take melatonin if:\nYou take other prescription or OTC medicines.\nYou have ongoing health problems.\nYou are pregnant or nursing (it is unclear what effect melatonin can have on an unborn baby or nursing infant).\nStore melatonin out of reach and sight of young children. Keep medicines and supplements in a cool, dry place. This helps prevent them from becoming less effective before they expire. Do not store them in bathrooms, which are often hot and humid.\nThings to consider\nThere is little scientific evidence that melatonin has a role in promoting health or treating disease. Melatonin also is not proven to slow down the aging process or prolong your life.\nSome people who have taken melatonin have reported side effects. These include:\ndrowsiness\nheadache\na \xe2\x80\x9cheavy-head\xe2\x80\x9d feeling\nnausea\nfeeling hungover\ndepression.\nFurther study is needed to find out more about melatonin\xe2\x80\x99s side effects, especially the delayed or long-term effects. It is unknown if melatonin causes problems when taken with other medicines. It also is unknown if melatonin affects people who have certain diseases and conditions.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nHow do I know if I should take melatonin supplements?\nIs it best to take melatonin in the short-term or long-term?\nIs it more or less safe to take melatonin than other OTC or prescription medicines?\nIs melatonin safe for children to take?\nLast Updated: January 12, 2018\nThis article was contributed by familydoctor.org editorial staff.\nCategories: Drugs, Procedures & Devices, Over-the-counter Products, Your Health ResourcesTags: Alternative Medicine, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Dietary Supplements, melatonin, sleep disorders September 1, 2000\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

With this approach, a doctor can be in one location and the patient in another. The two can talk using technology. This includes videoconferencing, store-and-forward imaging (sharing data), streaming media, and wireless communications. Telemedicine is different from telehealth. Telehealth refers to remote health services that are non-clinical. Telehealth may involve nurses, social workers, pharmacists, etc.\nThe AAFP supports the use of telehealth and telemedicine to improve health. However, it must follow appropriate standards of care.\nPath to improved well being\nTelemedicine began as a way to serve rural populations with limited access to doctors. It is \xc2\xa0gaining popularity everywhere because of the advantages it offers. These include:\nDoctors are passing on the expense of a standard \xe2\x80\x9cbrick and mortar\xe2\x80\x9d office.\nPatients don\xe2\x80\x99t have to travel to an office. They can see the doctor from their home, their car, or their workplace.\nAccess to quality care. If you live in a remote area, your choices of doctors may be limited. This opens the door to more doctors and more specialists.\nBetter management of chronic disease. Patients are more likely to keep their appointments when it\xe2\x80\x99s convenient. This means they are more likely to manage their chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes.\nMedicaid allows for the use of telemedicine. Providers must offer efficiency, economy, and quality of care. Providers must have a valid medical license in the patient\xe2\x80\x99s state.\nTelemedicine can be used for diagnostic tests, progress monitoring, and with specialists outside the patient\xe2\x80\x99s area.\nTelemedicine can help with the following:\nallergies\narthritis\nasthma, respiratory and sinus infections\nbronchitis\ncolds and flu\ndiarrhea or constipation\ninfections\ninsect bites\npharyngitis\npink eye\nrashes\nskin rashes, infections or inflammation\nsore throats\nsprained or strained bones\nbladder infections and UTIs\nsports injuries\nother physical injuries\nvomiting, heartburn, and nausea\njoint aches and pain\nheadaches\nsmall wounds and cuts\nfever\nTelemedicine can be used in these medical specialties:\npsychiatry\ndermatology\nophthalmology\noncology\nobstetrics\nphysical rehabilitation\nCertain situations make telemedicine ideal. These include:\nvacations\nappointments outside regular office hours\nnon-emergency care\nno one to watch young children at home\nprescription refills\nlab results\ntime off of work\nbudget\nThings to consider\nThere are a few drawbacks to telemedicine. These include:\nNot all exams can be performed digitally.\nYour doctor may lack the training to interact digitally.\nPatients may not have access to technology.\nThe sharing of records may not go smoothly\nTechnical difficulties\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nDo most doctors offer telemedicine?\nWill my insurance pay for it?\nAre patients at increased risk of medical error with telemedicine?\nResources\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC): Telehealth, Telemedicine and Telecare: What\xe2\x80\x99s What?\nMedicaid.gov: Telemedicine\nLast Updated: June 17, 2019\nThis article was contributed by familydoctor.org editorial staff.\nCategories: Healthcare Management, Your Health ResourcesTags: rural health, rural medicine, technology, telehealth, telemedicine July 2, 2019\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It is often performed by your family doctor or a gynecologist. They use a tool called a colposcope. It shines a light on the cervix and magnifies the view.\nA colposcopy often is done if you have an abnormal Pap smear. The purpose of the exam is to get a close look at a woman\xe2\x80\x99s cervix. The doctor can see and diagnose problems they can\xe2\x80\x99t see with the naked eye. For example, the doctor can detect cervical cancer at an early stage.\nPath to improved health\nBefore the exam\nA colposcopy is a short outpatient exam. It is typically done in a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office. Prior to the exam, you should empty your bladder and bowels. Do not douche, have sex, or use vaginal medicines or tampons 24 hours before your appointment. Be sure to let your doctor know if you are pregnant or are allergic to latex, iodine, or certain medicines.\nDuring the exam\nThe complete exam takes about 20 to 30 minutes. The doctor has you lie face up on an exam table. You bend your legs and place your feet in stirrups, as you would for a pelvic exam or Pap smear. First, the doctor inserts a speculum into your vagina. This small tool opens your vagina so they can see inside your vagina and the outside of your cervix. Then, the doctor applies a solution of vinegar or iodine to your cervix with a cotton swab. The solution makes potentially abnormal tissue turn white.\nNext, the doctor looks at your cervix through the colposcope. They may take photographs with a tiny camera. If the doctor sees spots of abnormal tissue, they will perform a biopsy. This involves removing small samples of tissue from the abnormal area in or around your cervix. The samples are sent to a lab to examine.\nYou may experience some discomfort during the exam. You could have mild cramps caused by the speculum opening your cervix. You may feel a slight pinch and cramping when the doctor removes tissue to biopsy. Try to relax your muscles and take slow, deep breaths.\nAfter the exam\nFollowing the exam, you may have mild cramps. You can take an over-the-counter medicine to help relieve the pain. Ask your doctor what kind to take, as well as how much and when to take it. You also could have some vaginal discharge for 1 or 2 days. During the biopsy, your doctor may put a thick paste on your cervix to stop any bleeding. When this paste mixes with blood, it can form a thick, dark discharge. Light spotting is normal as well. Your doctor will probably recommend wearing a sanitary pad.\nYou should not use a tampon, have sex, or put anything in your vagina for at least 1 week after the exam.\nThings to consider\nIt takes about 1 to 2 weeks for the lab to process the biopsy. Your doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office will contact you with the results and let you know if treatment is needed.\nNormal results indicate that no abnormal changes were found. Abnormal results can indicate several things.\nCervical polpys (growths on the cervix). These are not cancerous.\nCervical warts.\nHPV (human papilloma virus). The biopsy can diagnose the specific strain of the infection.\nCervicitis (inflammation of the cervix).\nCervical dysplasia (precancerous changes in the cervical tissue).\nCervical cancer.\nThe risks of a colposcopy are very low. You can have mild pain, bleeding, or discharge. A colposcopy should not prevent you from getting pregnant in the future.\nWhen to see a doctor\nCall your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms after your exam.\nHeavy vaginal bleeding (using more than one sanitary pad per hour).\nA bad-smelling vaginal odor.\nSevere lower stomach pain.\nFever or chills.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nIs it possible to do a colposcopy if I am pregnant?\nWhat are the benefits and risks of a colposcopy?\nHow soon after a colposcopy can I return to my normal activities?\nWhat types of treatment may be needed if my biopsy results come back abnormal?\nLast Updated: October 25, 2017\nThis article was contributed by familydoctor.org editorial staff.\nCategories: Drugs, Procedures & Devices, Family Health, Procedures & Devices, Women, Your Health ResourcesTags: cervical cancer, colposcopy, Colposcopy with biopsy, Colposcopy without biopsy, female, gynecologic September 1, 2000\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Jentzer, M.D., a consultant in cardiovascular diseases and pulmonary and critical care medicine at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.PEARL study overviewCardiac arrest is a common and potentially lethal condition in which the heart suddenly can\'t pump enough blood to the brain and body. Cardiac arrest is often caused by a heart attack, which usually is diagnosed by the presence of ST elevation on an ECG.\nCoronary angiography (also known as heart catheterization, or heart cath) is typically performed for patients with cardiac arrest due to a heart attack with ST elevation on their ECGs. Some cardiac arrest patients without ST elevation on their ECGs may be having a heart attack, but uncertainty remains about the best approach for their care.\nThe PEARL study will help answer the question, ""Does an early heart cath improve survival and prevent heart muscle damage after a cardiac arrest without ST segment elevation on the ECG?""\nStudy eligibilityAdult patients who are resuscitated from cardiac arrest outside the hospital will be enrolled in the PEARL study if they meet all the eligibility criteria.\nThe PEARL study is being conducted using a process called exception from informed consent (EFIC), which allows patients to be enrolled in emergency research trials without their direct consent. Review the PEARL Q & A information sheet to learn more about the EFIC process.\nPatients enrolled in the PEARL study will be randomized into one of two groups: either to receive immediate coronary angiography (within 120 minutes of hospital arrival) or to receive initial medical stabilization in the intensive care unit prior to delayed coronary angiography (more than six hours after hospital arrival). Both groups will otherwise receive the same high-quality post-arrest care.Opting outPatients who don\'t want to be enrolled in this research study if they have a cardiac arrest can opt out of participation in advance by requesting an opt-out wristband to wear.\nTo request an opt-out wristband or for more information about opting out of the Mayo Clinic PEARL study, email the research team or call 507-538-7178.More informationReview these documents to learn more about the PEARL study at Mayo Clinic:\nPEARL study fact sheet\nPEARL study Q & A\nPEARL study at Mayo Clinic\nPEARL study main NIH website\nCommunity feedbackOne of the most important aspects of performing the PEARL study under the EFIC process is to engage community members in order to understand and address any concerns.\nYou can provide feedback to the Mayo Clinic study team by completing a short survey about the PEARL study:\nPEARL study survey\nContact informationTo request an opt-out wristband or for more information about the PEARL study at Mayo Clinic, email the research team or call 507-538-7178.\nMore about research at Mayo Clinic\nExplore Research Labs\nFind Clinical Trials\nResearch Faculty\nPostdoctoral Fellowships\nDiscovery\'s Edge Magazine\nSearch Publications\nTraining Grant Programs\nCore Resources\n.\nART-20214405\nMayo Clinic Footer\nRequest AppointmentGive NowContact UsAbout Mayo ClinicEmployeesSite MapAbout This Site\nLegal Conditions and TermsAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nAdvertisingMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

But these drugs also carry a risk of serious side effects. Working with your doctor, you can take steps to reduce these side effects so that the benefits of corticosteroid treatment outweigh the risks.\nHow do corticosteroids work?\nCorticosteroids mimic the effects of hormones your body produces naturally in your adrenal glands, which are small glands that sit on top of your kidneys. When prescribed in doses that exceed your body\'s usual levels, corticosteroids suppress inflammation. This can reduce the signs and symptoms of inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis and asthma.\nCorticosteroids also suppress your immune system, which can help control conditions in which your immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues.\nHow are corticosteroids used?\nCorticosteroid drugs are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, asthma, allergies and many other conditions. They also treat Addison\'s disease, a condition where the adrenal glands aren\'t able to produce even the minimum amount of corticosteroid that the body needs. And these drugs also help suppress the immune system in order to prevent organ rejection in transplant recipients.\nYou can take corticosteroids:\nBy mouth. Tablets, capsules or syrups help treat the inflammation and pain associated with certain chronic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.\nBy inhaler and intranasal spray. These forms help control inflammation associated with asthma and nasal allergies.\nTopically. Creams and ointments can help heal many skin conditions.\nBy injection. This form is often used to treat muscle and joint signs and symptoms, such as the pain and inflammation of tendinitis.\nWhat side effects can corticosteroids cause?\nCorticosteroids carry a risk of side effects, some of which can cause serious health problems. When you know what side effects are possible, you can take steps to control their impact.\nSide effects of oral corticosteroids\nBecause oral corticosteroids affect your entire body instead of just a particular area, this route of administration is the most likely to cause significant side effects. Side effects depend on the dose of medication you receive and may include:\nElevated pressure in the eyes (glaucoma)\nFluid retention, causing swelling in your lower legs\nHigh blood pressure\nProblems with mood swings, memory and behavior and other psychological effects, such as confusion or delirium\nWeight gain, with fat deposits in your abdomen, face and the back of your neck\nWhen taking oral corticosteroids longer term, you may experience:\nClouding of the lens in one or both eyes (cataracts)\nHigh blood sugar, which can trigger or worsen diabetes\nIncreased risk of infections, especially with common bacterial, viral and fungal microorganisms\nThinning bones (osteoporosis) and fractures\nSuppressed adrenal gland hormone production, which may result in a variety of signs and symptoms, including severe fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea and muscle weakness\nThin skin, bruising and slower wound healing\nSide effects of inhaled corticosteroids\nWhen using inhaled corticosteroids, some of the drug may deposit in your mouth and throat instead of making it to your lungs. This can cause:\nFungal infection in the mouth (oral thrush)\nHoarseness\nIf you gargle and rinse your mouth with water \xe2\x80\x94 don\'t swallow \xe2\x80\x94 after each puff on your corticosteroid inhaler, you may be able to avoid mouth and throat irritation. Some researchers have speculated that inhaled corticosteroid drugs may slow growth rates in children who use them for asthma.\nSide effects of topical corticosteroids\nTopical corticosteroids can lead to thin skin, red skin lesions and acne.\nSide effects of injected corticosteroids\nInjected corticosteroids can cause temporary side effects near the site of the injection, including skin thinning, loss of color in the skin, and intense pain \xe2\x80\x94 also known as post-injection flare. Other signs and symptoms may include facial flushing, insomnia and high blood sugar. Doctors usually limit corticosteroid injections to three or four a year, depending on each patient\'s situation.\nReduce your risk of corticosteroid side effects\nTo get the most benefit from corticosteroid medications with the least amount of risk:\nTry lower doses or intermittent dosing. Newer forms of corticosteroids come in various strengths and lengths of action. Ask your doctor about using low-dose, short-term medications or taking oral corticosteroids every other day instead of daily.\nSwitch to nonoral forms of corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids for asthma, for example, reach lung surfaces directly, reducing the rest of your body\'s exposure to them and leading to fewer side effects.\nMake healthy choices during therapy. When you\'re taking corticosteroid medications for a long time, talk with your doctor about ways to minimize side effects. Eat a healthy diet and participate in activities that help you maintain a healthy weight and strengthen bones and muscles.\nConsider taking calcium and vitamin D supplements. Long-term corticosteroid therapy may cause thinning bones (osteoporosis). Talk with your doctor about taking calcium and vitamin D supplements to help protect your bones.\nTake care when discontinuing therapy. If you take oral corticosteroids for a long time, your adrenal glands may produce less of their natural steroid hormones. To give your adrenal glands time to recover this function, your doctor may reduce your dosage gradually. If the dosage is reduced too quickly, your adrenal glands may not have time to recover and you may experience fatigue, body aches and lightheadedness.\nWear a medical alert bracelet. This or similar identification is recommended if you\'ve been using corticosteroids for a long time.\nGet regular checkups. If you\'re taking long-term corticosteroid therapy, see your doctor regularly to check for side effects.\nWeigh the risks and benefits of corticosteroids\nCorticosteroids may cause a range of side effects. But they may also relieve the inflammation, pain and discomfort of many different diseases and conditions. If you work with your doctor to make choices that minimize side effects, you may achieve significant benefits with a reduced risk of such problems.\nShareTweet\nOct. 09, 2019\nShow references\nBolognia JL, et al.

The\xc2\xa0IUD\xc2\xa0can be a coil, loop, triangle, or T in shape made of\xc2\xa0plastic\xc2\xa0or metal.\xc2\xa0An IUD is inserted into the uterus by a health care professional. How IUDs prevent pregnancy is not entirely clear. They seem to prevent sperm and eggs from meeting by either immobilizing the sperm on their way to the fallopian tubes or by changing the uterine lining so the fertilized egg cannot implant in it. IUDs have one of the lowest failure rates of any contraceptive method. In the population for which the IUD is appropriate -- for those in a mutually monogamous, stable relationship who are not at a high risk of infection -- the IUD is considered a safe and effective contraception method.\xc2\xa0 Today, serious complication from IUDs are rare, although IUD users may be at increased risk of developing\xc2\xa0pelvic inflammatory disease.

When a woman menstruates, the lining of the uterus is shed. This shedding of the uterine linking is the menstrual blood flow. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days. There can be problems with a woman\'s period, including heavy bleeding, pain, or skipped periods. Causes of these problems may be amenorrhea (lack of a period), menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea), or abnormal vaginal or uterine bleeding. There are a variety of situations in which a girl or woman should see a doctor about her menstrual cycle.\nVaginal Bleeding\nNormal vaginal bleeding (menorrhea) occurs through the process of menstruation. Abnormal vaginal bleeding in women who are ovulating regularly most commonly involves excessive, frequent, irregular, or decreased bleeding. Causes of abnormal may arise from a variety of conditions that may include, uterine fibroids, IUDs, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, lupus, STDs, pelvic inflammatory disease, emotional stress, anorexia nervosa, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), cancers, early pregnancy.\nBirth Control Options (Types and Side Effects)\nBirth control is available in a variety of methods and types. The method of birth control varies from person to person, and their preferences to either become pregnant or not. Examples of barrier methods include barrier methods (sponge, spermicides, condoms), hormonal methods (pill, patch), surgical sterilization (tubal ligation, vasectomy), natural methods, and the morning after pill.\nSide effects and risks of each birth control option should be reviewed prior to using any birth control method.\nEctopic Pregnancy (Tubal Pregnancy)\nAn ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy located outside the inner lining of the uterus. The majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the Fallopian tube. Signs and symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy may include abdominal pain, lack of menstrual period (amenorrhea), vaginal bleeding, fainting, dizziness, and low blood pressure.\nTreatment options for an ectopic pregnancy include observation, medication, or surgery.\nSexually Transmitted Diseases in Women (STDs)\nSexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are among the most common infectious diseases in the United States. STDs can be spread through any type of sexual activity involving the sex organs, the\nanus or mouth, or through contact with blood during sexual activity. Examples of STDs include, chancroid, chlamydia, gonorrhea, granuloma inguinale, lymphogranuloma venereum, syphilis, genital herpes, genital warts, trichomoniasis, pubic lice (crabs), and scabies. Treatment is generally with antibiotics; however, some STDs that go untreated can lead to death.\nTrichomoniasis\nTrichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by a parasite passed from person to person. Trichomoniasis can be picked up from contact with damp, moist objects like towels, wet clothing, or toilet seat. Symptoms include\nyellow, green, or gray\nvaginal discharge with a strong odor,\npainful intercourse or urination,\ngenital irritation and\nitching, and\nlower\nabdominal pain.\nAntibiotics are the only treatment to cure trichomoniasis.\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is the most common and serious complication of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), aside from AIDS, among women. The signs and symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease include: fever, vaginal discharge with a foul odor, abdominal pain, including pain during intercourse, and irregular vaginal bleeding. Pelvic inflammatory disease can scar the Fallopian tubes, ovaries, and related structures and lead to ectopic pregnancies, infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and other serious consequences. Pelvic inflammatory disease treatment includes several types of antibiotics.\nBladder Infection (Cystitis)\nBladder infection is an infection of the bladder, usually caused by bacteria or, rarely, by Candida. Certain people, including females, the elderly, men with enlarged prostates, and those with chronic medical conditions are at increased risk for bladder infection. Bladder infections are treated with antibiotics, but cranberry products and adequate hydration may help prevent bladder infections.\nBirth Control Pill vs. Shot (Depo-Provera): Similarities and Differences\nBirth control pills (oral contraceptives) and the Depo-Provera shot are two hormonal methods of birth control. Both methods work by changing the hormone levels in your body, which prevents pregnancy, or conception. Differences between ""the pill"" and ""the shot."" Birth control pills are available as combination pills, which contain the hormones estrogen and progestin, or mini-pills that only contain progestin. In comparison to the Depo-Provera injection, which prevents pregnancy for three consecutive months. Both methods of birth control are very effective in preventing pregnancy. Both the combination pill (if you take them as directed) and shot are up to 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. While the mini-pill is only about 95% effective in preventing pregnancy. Both methods cause weight gain, and have other similar side effects like breast pain, soreness or tenderness, headaches, and mood changes. They may lead to decreased interest in sex in some women. There are differences between the other side effects of these methods (depending upon the method) that include breakthrough bleeding or spotting, acne, depression, fatigue, and weakness. Both oral contraceptives and the Depo-Provera shot have health risks associated with them, such as, heart attack, stroke, blood clots, and cervical cancer. Birth control pills appear to increase the risk of cervical cancer. Talk with your OB/GYN or other doctor or health care professional about which birth control method is right for you.\nMenstrual Cramps and Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) Medication Guide\nMenstrual cramps and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms include abdominal cramping, bloating, a feeling of fullness, abdominal pain, mood swings, anxiety and more. Treatment for menstrual cramps and\npremenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms include regular sleep, exercise, smoking cessation, diet changes, and OTC or prescription medication depending on the severity of the condition.\nInfertility\nInfertility is the diminished ability to conceive a child. Infertility can be a problem with both men and women. Infertility in men can be caused by medical conditions, unhealthy habits, and toxins from the environment. Infertility in women can be caused by problems with ovarian function, the Fallopian tubes, or the physical characteristics of the uterus. Methods of conceiving for couples that cannot conceive include intrauterine inseminations (IUIs) or in vitro fertilization (IVF), specific drugs, assisted reproductive technology (ART), surgery, and gestational carrier.\nMiscarriage\nMiscarriage is the medical term for the spontaneous loss of pregnancy from conception to 20 weeks gestation. Risk factors for a woman having a miscarriage include cigarette smoking, older maternal age, radiation exposure, previous miscarriage, maternal weight, illicit drug use, use of NSAIDs, and trauma or anatomical abnormalities to the uterus. There are five classified types of miscarriage: 1) threatened abortion; 2) incomplete abortion; 3) complete abortion; 4) missed abortion; and (5 septic abortion. While there are no specific treatments to stop a miscarriage, a woman\'s doctor may advise avoiding certain activities, bed rest, etc. If a woman believes she has had a miscarriage, she needs to seek prompt medical attention.\nMenstrual Cramps\nMenstrual cramps (pain in the belly and pelvic area) are experienced by women as a result of menses. Menstrual cramps are not the same as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Menstrual cramps are common, and may be accompanied by headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea. Severity of menstrual cramp pain varies from woman to woman. Treatment includes OTC or prescription pain relief medication.\nDVT and Birth Control Pills (Oral Contraceptives)\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that has traveled deep into the veins of the arm, pelvis, or lower extremities. Oral contraceptives or birth control pills can slightly increase a woman\xe2\x80\x99s risk for developing blood clots, including DVT. DVT symptoms and signs in the leg include leg or calf pain, redness, swelling, warmth, or leg cramps, and skin discoloration. If a blood clot in the leg is not treated, it can travel to the lungs, which can cause a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung) or post-thrombotic syndrome, both of which can be fatal if not treated immediately. Increased risk factors for DVT and birth control pills include over 40 years of age, family history, smoking, and obesity. Other medical problems that increase the risks of blood clots, for example, lung or heart disease, or inflammatory bowel disease or IBD (Crohn\xe2\x80\x99s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). Other options for preventing pregnancy include IUDs, birth control shots, condoms, diaphragms, and progestin-only oral contraceptives.\nSexually Transmitted Diseases and Pregnancy (STDs)\nWhen you are pregnant, many sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can be especially harmful to you and your baby. These STDs include herpes, HIV/AIDS, genital warts (HPV), hepatitis B, chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis. Symptoms include bumps, sores, warts, swelling, itching, or redness in the genital region. Treatment of STDs while pregnant depends on how far along you are in the pregnancy and the progression of the infection.\nReproductive Health\nReproductive health encompasses the beginning of menstruation for women, choosing the right birth control method for you and your partner, preventing contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and for women, ending with the menopausal transition.\nSexual Health\nSexual health information including birth control, impotence, herpes, sexually transmitted diseases, staying healthy, women\'s sexual health concerns, and men\'s sexual health concerns.

Long-acting reversible contraception, or LARC, is reversible birth control that provides long-lasting (think years) pregnancy prevention. While not currently the leading choice among women, LARC use has been on the rise in recent years. In women aged 15-44, LARC use has grown from 1.5% in 2002 to 7.2% in 2011\xe2\x80\x932013. The rising popularity of LARC can likely be attributed to its high rate of effectiveness (more than 99 percent) and ease of use.\nLARC methods, which include intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants, are highly reliable\xe2\x80\x94research has shown LARC to be 20 times more effective than birth control pills, the patch, or the vaginal ring. One important reason why is the LARC removes the \xe2\x80\x9cuser error\xe2\x80\x9d factor that can make other methods less effective. No need to remember to take a pill daily, or have a diaphragm on hand ready to go. Once LARC is in place, it does its job for years with no input from the user at all, acting as a \xe2\x80\x9cset it and forget it\xe2\x80\x9d method.\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be forgotten\xe2\x80\x94protecting against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). While LARC is a highly effective way to prevent pregnancy, LARC methods don\xe2\x80\x99t prevent STIs. For this reason, many choose to use (and health professionals recommend) condoms in addition to a LARC method. Dual use of condoms and LARC thus offers couples dual prevention.\nASHA\xe2\x80\x99s Fred Wyand (a.k.a. Fredo) discusses\xc2\xa0dual use of LARC and condoms\xc2\xa0in the latest episode of ASHA Sex+Health podcast. Fred explains the facts about LARC and the added benefit of dual use of LARC and condoms to prevent STIs.\nLARC Methods\nThere are two LARC methods: the intrauterine device (IUD) and the birth control implant. The intrauterine device (IUD) was once a popular choice in the U.S., but following problems linked to the poorly designed Dalkon Shield model in the 1970s, usage dropped due to concerns about safety. The current newly designed models share none of the earlier safety concerns, but some misconceptions about this issue persist.\nThe birth control implant has been available in the United States since the 1990s. The earliest model, Norplant, included multiple rods implanted under the skin and offered pregnancy prevention for up to five years. Almost immediately after its approval, however, it became a target for misuse, as legislation was introduced in several states mandating its use in specific groups of women, including those receiving public assistance. Use of implants became an issue in the courts, as women facing charges including child and abuse and neglect were offered the option of accepting implants as condition of a reduced sentence.\nUnderstanding and acknowledging this history of coercive use of LARC and safety concerns is important, to avoid problems of the past. But so too is understanding the potential value of LARC methods today. The current concern with LARC is making sure women are well informed about these methods, including benefits and side effects, and making LARC an accessible and affordable option to all women.\nIUD: An IUD is a small T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus by a healthcare provider. It works by preventing sperm from fertilizing an egg. The hormonal type of IUD also thins the uterine lining, making it more difficult for a fertilized egg to implant.\nThere are two types of IUDs:\nHormonal IUD: This plastic IUD releases the hormone progestin. One type, Mirena, is approved for use for up to 5 years, while another, Skyla, is approved for use for up to 3 years.\nCopper IUD: The copper IUD, Paraguard, is hormone-free. It is approved for use for up to 10 years.\nWhile both types of IUDs can remain in place for years, they can also easily be removed if a woman decides she would like to become pregnant. Most women have no issues with the IUD, but problems can include spotting between periods, a heavier flow (with Paraguard), and back pains. Rare but serious problems can occur as well, and usually happen shortly after the IUD is inserted. These complications include the IUD falling out of the uterus, or piercing the uterine wall. Learn more about IUDs and hear stories from real women who use this method at Bedsider.\nImplant: The birth control implant is a single small, thin rod that is inserted under the skin of a women\xe2\x80\x99s upper arm by a healthcare provider. The rod releases the hormone progestin into the body, which both helps prevent ovulation and thickens cervical mucus, helping prevent sperm from reaching an egg. The implant prevents pregnancy for up to 3 years.\nAs with the IUD, the implant can be removed at any time if a woman decides to get pregnant. The most common side effect is irregular bleeding\xe2\x80\x94including spotting between periods and heavier periods. This typically improves over time. Learn more about implants and hear stories of women using this method at Bedsider.\nChoosing LARC\nSo with all the potential benefits, why is LARC not a more popular choice? One reason is the large upfront cost. Both methods must be inserted, and removed, by a physician and costs cannot be spread out over time as with other methods. However, under the Affordable Care Act, all insurance plans in the health insurance marketplace must cover all FDA-approved contraceptive methods prescribed by a woman\xe2\x80\x99s doctor, including LARC.\nAnother factor involves misconceptions about safety, even on the part of providers. In a 2012 study, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that nearly a third of healthcare providers had misconceptions about the safety of IUDs for women who have never had children. Such concerns are misplaced\xe2\x80\x94the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that LARC methods be offered as first-line birth control methods and encouraged as options for most women, including adolescents and women who have never had children.\nLARC offers women a safe, long-lasting choice for preventing pregnancy\xe2\x80\x94one that requires no real thought or effort over years. It\xe2\x80\x99s an option that most women should consider a viable choice.\nPrimary Sidebar#YESMEANSTEST\nDo It For Your Country!\nExpress Yourself\nIn the News\nSexually Transmitted Disease SurveillanceSweet Harmony: ACIP Updates HPV Vaccine Recommendations for Males and FemalesDesperate Housewives Star Talks about her Anal Cancer DiagnosisAccess Denied:\nAbortion Rights ThreatenedFDA Approves HPV Vaccine for Adults Over 26\nConnect with ASHA\nGet Involved\nTune In\nConnect with ASHA\nSecondary SidebarKnow Your Body\nSexual Pleasure\nRecognize Problems\nVaginal Health\nSelf image\nSelf-Assessment Tool for Young Females\nMenopause\nSexual Difficulties in Women\nReproductive Health\nWomen and STIs\nPreventive Care and the ACA\nFooter Site Use and Privacy\nOnline Support Community\nSexual Health Glossary\nLinks to other sites\nContact Us\nContact Us\nASHA\nPO Box 13827\nResearch Triangle Park, NC 27709\n919.361.8400\ninfo@ashasexualhealth.org\nSearch this site\nSearch this website\nCopyright \xc2\xa9\xc2\xa02020 \xc2\xb7 American Sexual Health Association'"

Once LARC is in place, it does its job for years with no input from the user at all, acting as a \xe2\x80\x9cset it and forget it\xe2\x80\x9d method.\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be forgotten\xe2\x80\x94protecting against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). While LARC is a highly effective way to prevent pregnancy, LARC methods don\xe2\x80\x99t prevent STIs. For this reason, many choose to use (and health professionals recommend) condoms in addition to a LARC method. Dual use of condoms and LARC thus offers couples dual prevention.\nASHA\xe2\x80\x99s Fred Wyand (a.k.a. Fredo) discusses\xc2\xa0dual use of LARC and condoms\xc2\xa0in the latest episode of ASHA Sex+Health podcast. Fred explains the facts about LARC and the added benefit of dual use of LARC and condoms to prevent STIs.\nLARC Methods\nThere are two LARC methods: the intrauterine device (IUD) and the birth control implant. The intrauterine device (IUD) was once a popular choice in the U.S., but following problems linked to the poorly designed Dalkon Shield model in the 1970s, usage dropped due to concerns about safety. The current newly designed models share none of the earlier safety concerns, but some misconceptions about this issue persist.\nThe birth control implant has been available in the United States since the 1990s. The earliest model, Norplant, included multiple rods implanted under the skin and offered pregnancy prevention for up to five years. Almost immediately after its approval, however, it became a target for misuse, as legislation was introduced in several states mandating its use in specific groups of women, including those receiving public assistance. Use of implants became an issue in the courts, as women facing charges including child and abuse and neglect were offered the option of accepting implants as condition of a reduced sentence.\nUnderstanding and acknowledging this history of coercive use of LARC and safety concerns is important, to avoid problems of the past. But so too is understanding the potential value of LARC methods today. The current concern with LARC is making sure women are well informed about these methods, including benefits and side effects, and making LARC an accessible and affordable option to all women.\nIUD: An IUD is a small T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus by a healthcare provider. It works by preventing sperm from fertilizing an egg. The hormonal type of IUD also thins the uterine lining, making it more difficult for a fertilized egg to implant.\nThere are two types of IUDs:\nHormonal IUD: This plastic IUD releases the hormone progestin. One type, Mirena, is approved for use for up to 5 years, while another, Skyla, is approved for use for up to 3 years.\nCopper IUD: The copper IUD, Paraguard, is hormone-free. It is approved for use for up to 10 years.\nWhile both types of IUDs can remain in place for years, they can also easily be removed if a woman decides she would like to become pregnant. Most women have no issues with the IUD, but problems can include spotting between periods, a heavier flow (with Paraguard), and back pains. Rare but serious problems can occur as well, and usually happen shortly after the IUD is inserted. These complications include the IUD falling out of the uterus, or piercing the uterine wall. Learn more about IUDs and hear stories from real women who use this method at Bedsider.\nImplant: The birth control implant is a single small, thin rod that is inserted under the skin of a women\xe2\x80\x99s upper arm by a healthcare provider. The rod releases the hormone progestin into the body, which both helps prevent ovulation and thickens cervical mucus, helping prevent sperm from reaching an egg. The implant prevents pregnancy for up to 3 years.\nAs with the IUD, the implant can be removed at any time if a woman decides to get pregnant. The most common side effect is irregular bleeding\xe2\x80\x94including spotting between periods and heavier periods. This typically improves over time. Learn more about implants and hear stories of women using this method at Bedsider.\nChoosing LARC\nSo with all the potential benefits, why is LARC not a more popular choice? One reason is the large upfront cost. Both methods must be inserted, and removed, by a physician and costs cannot be spread out over time as with other methods. However, under the Affordable Care Act, all insurance plans in the health insurance marketplace must cover all FDA-approved contraceptive methods prescribed by a woman\xe2\x80\x99s doctor, including LARC.\nAnother factor involves misconceptions about safety, even on the part of providers. In a 2012 study, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that nearly a third of healthcare providers had misconceptions about the safety of IUDs for women who have never had children. Such concerns are misplaced\xe2\x80\x94the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that LARC methods be offered as first-line birth control methods and encouraged as options for most women, including adolescents and women who have never had children.\nLARC offers women a safe, long-lasting choice for preventing pregnancy\xe2\x80\x94one that requires no real thought or effort over years. It\xe2\x80\x99s an option that most women should consider a viable choice.\nUpdate on Teen Sexual Behavior & Contraception Use\nThe number of teens who have had sex remained stable in recent years while the rate of contraception use has increased, according to a report released in June from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), Sexual Activity and Contraceptive Use Among Teenagers in the United States, 2011-2015.\nUsing in-person interviews with males and females in the U.S. ages 15-44, the NSFG collects data on topics such as relationships, pregnancy, contraception use, and reproductive health. Key findings from the most recent data include:\nAmong never-married teens in 2011-2015, 42% of females and 44% of males had sexual intercourse at least one time, similar to numbers from 2006-2010.\nIn 2011-2015 81% of female teens used some type of contraception when they first had intercourse, up from 74% in 2002. Male teens\xe2\x80\x99 use of condoms at first intercourse jumped from 71% in 2002 to nearly 77% in 2011-2015.\nEducating teens about sexual health is critical says ASHA president Lynn Barclay: \xe2\x80\x9cWhile these trends are encouraging we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t believe for a minute that the work is done. 20 million sexually transmitted infections occur each year in the U.S. and half are in youth ages 15-24.\xe2\x80\x9d Barclay says when it comes to educating young people, we need to focus on more than the physical aspects of sex. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does little good to tell a teen to \xe2\x80\x98use a condom\xe2\x80\x99 if they lack the skills or power to negotiate safer sex in a relationship. We need discussions around values, boundaries, gender differences and self-image. They all play a huge part in making healthy choices.\xe2\x80\x9d\nASHA has sexual health tools for health providers, parents, and educators along with an award-winning site for teens, iwannaknow.org.\nDrinking, Sex and a Healthy You!\nBy Charles Hassell\nMost people reading this have probably had a drink before. And you have probably had sex. In fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good chance you have done those two things on the same night! Most people are looking to do two things on a night out:\n1)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have fun with friends.\n2)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have a romantic experience.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s completely natural to go out for a night, have a few drinks, and find yourself talking to an attractive person. When those drinks kick in there may be some action to go along with the talk. You start dancing, getting more confident; we\xe2\x80\x99ve all been there.\nWhile the drinking age is 21, this drinking-and-feeling-sexy behavior can even begin at younger ages. In many countries the legal drinking age is lower than in the U.S. and some argue that is better, because there is less of a societal \xe2\x80\x9ctaboo\xe2\x80\x9d around drinking. No matter how you slice it, no matter where you go, it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for humans across the spectrum to mix looking for love with having a drink in hand.\nThe big problem with mixing drinking and sex is that alcohol impairs judgment. This could mean our sexual common sense drops a bit and leads to decisions we normally might not make, including having sex without protection. making decisions that aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best. \xc2\xa0Sleeping with someone you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise. OK, a little embarrassment, maybe some hurt feelings. But the real dangers have to do with unsafe sex. Imagine for a second\xe2\x80\xa6\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re looking for love at a party. After a fun night of drinking and dancing you find yourself back at your place with a hottie who wants to have sex- but one catch: your new squeeze prefers it with no protection (like a condom) or maybe neither of you thought to bring any. You both really want it\xe2\x80\xa6normally you\xe2\x80\x99d say \xe2\x80\x9cNo way!\xe2\x80\x9d but with the alcohol swirling along with your desires\xe2\x80\xa6maybe just this once? That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to buy and carry condoms, and keep some on hand.\nHave fun but be smart. And don\xe2\x80\x99t be fooled by these myths:\nMyth: Sex Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Fun With A Condom. If you are relaxed, with someone you are attracted too, sex is going to be fun. Plus condoms can help some guys last longer. You know what\xe2\x80\x99s really not fun? Regretting unprotected sex later.\nMyth: Condoms Don\xe2\x80\x99t Work. When used consistently and correctly, condoms are very effective at preventing STIs and unwanted pregnancy. They work!\nMyth: Just This Once Is OK. It only takes one time!\nWebsites like ASHAsexualhealth.org will give you the info you need to keep it real, keep it safe, and to stay in charge of your sex life. Please, by all means, go out and have fun. Meet your friends, grab a cold beer, enjoy it wrapped in your favorite koozie. Nothing wrong with drinking, laughing and having a good time. And if you decide to have sex with someone, enjoy that too! Wrapped in your favorite condom.\nOne great way to stay safe out on the town- and back in the sack- is to talk to your partner.

LARC methods, which include intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants, are highly reliable, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t prevent STIs. For this reason, many choose to use (and health professionals recommend) condoms in addition to a LARC method.

Subscribe today!\nSurvey: Young Adults Like Female Condoms Once They See and Touch Them\nYoung women and men both find many characteristics of female condoms appealing, a new study finds.\nThe female condom is a nitrile pouch that fits inside a woman\xe2\x80\x99s vagina. It has a soft ring on each end. The outer, larger ring stays on the outside of the vagina and partly covers the labia (lips). The inner ring fits on the inside of the vagina, somewhat like a diaphragm, to hold the condom in place. The female condom can also be used in the rectum for anal sex.\nFemale condoms are currently the only woman-controlled method of safer sex. Just as the development of oral contraceptives was revolutionary in giving women control over their reproductive status, female condoms offer women a method they control that provides effective protection against STIs.\nResearchers at the University of Texas at Arlington surveyed female and male students ages 18-24 to see what they think about female condoms. Design of the condom (including fit, comfort, and pleasure), lack of side effects, protection against STIs and pregnancy and convenience were important to females. These elements (especially protection and design) were also important to the men, along with the notion that a female-centric condom would potentially relieve them of some of the responsibility of providing protection (one man citing this as an advantage commented \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about wearing a condom\xe2\x80\x9d).\nOne curious finding is that while most participants had heard of female condoms, only a handful had actually seen or touched one before taking part in this study. Female condoms have had some difficulty gaining traction in a space dominated by male condoms and the researchers said that \xe2\x80\x9cSeeing and touching the [female condom] was a key element in this study. It gave the participants an opportunity to, not only get familiar with the FC but also, evaluate it by comparing it with other contraceptives.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRead more about female condoms, including how to use them, on the\xc2\xa0female\xc2\xa0condom page.\nReference: Shaw CM and Chatterjee K.

Long-acting reversible contraception, or LARC, is reversible birth control that provides long-lasting (think years) pregnancy prevention. While not currently the leading choice among women, LARC use has been on the rise in recent years. In women aged 15-44, LARC use has grown from 1.5% in 2002 to 7.2% in 2011\xe2\x80\x932013. The rising popularity of LARC can likely be attributed to its high rate of effectiveness (more than 99 percent) and ease of use.\nLARC methods, which include intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants, are highly reliable\xe2\x80\x94research has shown LARC to be 20 times more effective than birth control pills, the patch, or the vaginal ring. One important reason why is the LARC removes the \xe2\x80\x9cuser error\xe2\x80\x9d factor that can make other methods less effective. No need to remember to take a pill daily, or have a diaphragm on hand ready to go.

Now, Paps can be done alone or in combination with an HPV test (one HPV test can even be used for primary cervical cancer screening). Added to the mix is a set of updated guidelines that, for most women, means an annual cervical cancer screening exam is a thing of the past.\nIt can all be very confusing, even for healthcare providers! Not to worry: in this edition of ASHA\xe2\x80\x99s Sex+Health podcast we talk to Ina Park, MD, who sorts it all out for us. Dr. Park is an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, in the Department of Family and Community Medicine.

Wear a condom. Get a vasectomy. Pretty straight-forward, that. And sadly lacking.\nSad for men and their female partners, too. Condoms are great, especially in reducing the risk of a number of sexually transmitted infections like HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. No, condoms are awesome! Condoms are just less effective in preventing pregnancy than many female methods of contraception: male condoms are about 84% effective in this regard, compared to the pill (92%-97% effective), implants (99.9% effective), and IUDs (99% effective).\nVasectomy is highly effective in preventing pregnancy but involves surgery (although minor and outpatient) and is tough to reverse. So, a young, sexually active male who has sex with a woman has to either shift the burden/responsibility of reliable birth control to his partner or depend on a method that\xe2\x80\x99s either less-than-stellar in heading off pregnancy or, if he may want to have biological kids later, simply not practical.\nSo why are there so few male-centric birth control options? The fact that women are the ones most impacted by unintended pregnancies- and bolstered by a cultural view that pregnancy is really more of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s issue/problem/responsibility- means priority was placed on developing options for female contraception. Plus it\xe2\x80\x99s not a walk in the park to develop effective, safe, and reversible contraception options that guys will actually use. Such research is expensive, complex, filled with more ethical and technical challenges than you might think, all with a less than certain return on investment of time and resources.\nStill, the siren\xe2\x80\x99s song of new male contraception may play a sweet tune yet. A number of intriguing options are in fact being researched, hormonal and non-hormonal methods alike, everything from male versions of the pill to injections and even non-invasive procedures. Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that all that before, the male pill or whatever is right around the corner, but the variety and technological sophistication of these new-fangled items do give reason for optimism.\nOne candidate is RISUG (reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance). With this procedure, a polymer that inactivates sperm is injected into the vas deferens (the duct or tube through which sperm move during ejaculation). RISUG is still in development and who knows when or if it\xe2\x80\x99ll come to market, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just one example of the tantalizing research being done.\nWhat a great day that would be, when the male pill or some other highly effective, safe birth control option for the fellows becomes widely available. Who\xe2\x80\x99ll be cheering the loudest, the guys or their gals?\n\xe2\x80\x94Fred Wyand aka Fredo\nMale Birth Control On the Horizon: A Woman\xe2\x80\x99s View\nMale birth control is a saving grace for young women.

Wait, I\xe2\x80\x99m a strong independent woman.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d (Even the most well-rounded feminists will become overwhelmed with these thoughts.)\nThen there\xe2\x80\x99s getting weighed, answering questions about your sex life, and the possible \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d Pap smear that many health care providers still insist on.\nAfter that, you have to remember to take the pill every day at the same time and buzzing at the thought of having to do this for most of your adult life regardless of your dating status (just in case).\nYes, there are long-lasting implants and IUD\xe2\x80\x99s but the initial cost barrier excludes them from being totally accessible just yet.\nThe idea that one day, men may also have a part in controlling fertility in a relationship is more than exciting. (They are 49% of the population after all- how come it\xe2\x80\x99s taken this long in the first place?)\nYoung male friends of mine practically click their heels in the air when I tell them about the impending trials of experimental male birth control options such as Vasalgel and RISUG.\nThis couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come soon enough.\nMen deserve a say in the fertility of a relationship just as much as women do.\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine the lack of control some young men might feel.\nAnd even though men always have the option of condoms, even perfect use doesn\xe2\x80\x99t statistically stand a chance against some of the hormonal birth controls available to women right now.\nAnd the other option of vasectomy isn\xe2\x80\x99t logical for young people just starting out their lives.\nHowever, whether or not men will take advantage of birth control and whether women will trust them to do so remains a question to me.\nA girl (or a little more than 3.5 billion girls) can hope!\n\xe2\x80\x94Emily Duberman\nPrimary Sidebar#YESMEANSTEST\nDo It For Your Country!\nExpress Yourself\nIn the News\nSexually Transmitted Disease SurveillanceSweet Harmony: ACIP Updates HPV Vaccine Recommendations for Males and FemalesDesperate Housewives Star Talks about her Anal Cancer DiagnosisAccess Denied:\nAbortion Rights ThreatenedFDA Approves HPV Vaccine for Adults Over 26\nConnect with ASHA\nGet Involved\nTune In\nConnect with ASHA\nSecondary SidebarFooter Site Use and Privacy\nOnline Support Community\nSexual Health Glossary\nLinks to other sites\nContact Us\nContact Us\nASHA\nPO Box 13827\nResearch Triangle Park, NC 27709\n919.361.8400\ninfo@ashasexualhealth.org\nSearch this site\nSearch this website\nCopyright \xc2\xa9\xc2\xa02020 \xc2\xb7 American Sexual Health Association0'"

PID can be sexually transmitted or naturally occurring. It can lead to infertility in women (unable to have children) or life-threatening complications.\nFAQs\nHow common is it?Women between ages 15 and 25 have the highest incidence of PID. In the United States, PID is the leading cause of infertility in women (the inability to have children).\nHow is it transmitted?Two other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), chlamydia and gonorrhea, are the most common causes of PID. Other bacteria or germs can also cause PID. If you have an infection in the genital tract and do not get treated right away, it can cause PID. The infection spreads from the cervix into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. It can take anywhere from several days to several months after being infected to develop PID.\nWhat can cause an infection to spread into the upper genital tract?\nUsing an intrauterine device (IUD). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk for PID associated with IUD use is primarily confined to the first 3 weeks after insertion and is uncommon thereafter.\nGerms\nDouching. Women who douche once or twice a month are more likely to have PID than those who douche less than once a month. Douching may also ease symptoms of an infection, thus delaying effective treatment.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nDull pain or tenderness in the lower abdomen\nBurning or pain when you urinate (pee)\nNausea and vomiting\nBleeding between menstrual periods\nIncreased or changed vaginal discharge\nPain during sex\nFever and chills\nIt is possible for a woman to have PID and be asymptomatic (without symptoms), or have symptoms too mild to notice, for an unknown period of time. PID can also be misdiagnosed as appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cysts or other problems.\nHow is it diagnosed?The diagnosis of PID can be made when all three of the following symptoms are found during a pelvic exam:\nLower abdominal tenderness\nTenderness of fallopian tubes and ovaries\nTenderness of the cervix\nAll other explanations for these findings must have been ruled out, so your healthcare provider may also order tests to identify the organism which led to the infection (such as chlamydia or gonorrhea) or to distinguish between PID and other problems with similar symptoms.\nA pelvic ultrasound is a helpful procedure for diagnosing PID. An ultrasound can view the pelvic area to see whether the fallopian tubes are enlarged or whether an abscess (pus-filled area) is present.\nIn some cases, a laparoscopy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. A laparoscopy is a surgical procedure in which a thin, flexible tube with a lighted end (laparoscope) is inserted through a small incision in the lower abdomen. This procedure enables the doctor to view the internal pelvic organs and to take specimens for laboratory studies, if needed.\nHow is it treated?\nBroad-spectrum antibiotics are the recommended treatment, as they can cover the likely pathogens.\nTreatment may include antimicrobial agents to treat gonorrhea, chlamydia, streptococci and other gram-negative bacteria.\nOfloxacin (oh-flox-ah-sin) tablets (FLOXIN) can be used alone to treat PID.\nAggressive treatment of PID is recommended for women with HIV, who may be more likely to require surgical intervention.\nSex partners of patients who have PID should be examined and treated if they have had recent sexual contact to avoid re-infection.\nFollow-up:\nTake all medications as directed.\nYou may need a follow-up exam 48 to 72 hours after start of treatment to make sure the medicine is working.\nReturn for another exam after completion of treatment to make sure the infection is completely gone.\nTell your partner to get tested and treated.\nRemember: Do not have sex until you and your partner(s) have been treated and cured.\nHospitalization to treat PID may be recommended if a woman:\nis severely ill (nausea, vomiting, and high fever);\nis pregnant;\ndoes not respond to or cannot take oral medication and needs intravenous antibiotics;\nhas an abscess (infected area with pus) in the fallopian tube or ovary.\nIf symptoms continue or if an abscess does not go away, surgery may be needed. Complications of PID, such as chronic pelvic pain and scarring are difficult to treat, but sometimes they improve with surgery.\nWhat does it mean for my health?\nUntreated PID infections may lead to:\nInfertility. Because of PID, each year more than 100,000 women will not be able to have children as a result of scarring or damage to cells lining the fallopian tubes.\nCystitis (inflammation of the urinary bladder)\nEctopic (tubal) pregnancy\nRecurrent episodes of PID\nChronic pelvic pain\nHow can I reduce my risk?\nAbstain (do not have sex).\nUse latex condoms for vaginal, oral and anal sex from the very beginning of sexual contact until there is no longer skin contact.\nMutual monogamy (have sex with only one uninfected partner). Multiple sex partners can increase your risk for getting any STI and developing PID.\nHave regular check-ups if you are sexually active.\nIf you have an STI, do not have sex (oral, vaginal or anal) until all partners have been treated and cured. Treatment and follow-up are important steps in breaking the disease cycle.\nWater-based spermicides (foams, jellies, creams, or suppositories) can be used along with latex condoms for additional protection during vaginal intercourse. Use of spermicide is not recommended nor found to be effective for oral or anal intercourse.\nSince PID can be transmitted even if the penis or tongue does not completely enter the vagina, mouth or rectum, using latex condoms from the beginning of sexual contact until there is no longer skin contact is recommended.\nHow do I tell my partner?Telling a partner can be hard, but keep in mind that most people with an STI don\xe2\x80\x99t know they have it. It\xe2\x80\x99s important that you talk to your partner as soon as possible so she or he can get treatment. Men are more likely than women to have symptoms of chlamydia or gonorrhea (two STIs that cause PID). It is possible to pass PID back and forth, so if you get treated and your partner doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, you may get infected again.\nPrimary SidebarGet Help\nGet Involved\nExpress Yourself\nConnect with ASHA\nTune In\nYes Means Test\nSecondary SidebarGet Help\nStatistics\nReduce Your Risk\nGet Tested\nOral Sex and STIs\nSTIs and Cancer\nVaccines\nPrevention Tips\nMyths and Facts\nCondoms\nChlamydia\nCrabs\nGonorrhea\nHepatitis\nHerpes\nHIV\nHPV\nMGen\nMolluscum\nNGU\nPID\nScabies\nSyphilis\nTrichomoniasis\nJoin Our STI Online Support Community at Inspire\nFooter Site Use and Privacy\nOnline Support Community\nSexual Health Glossary\nLinks to other sites\nContact Us\nContact Us\nASHA\nPO Box 13827\nResearch Triangle Park, NC 27709\n919.361.8400\ninfo@ashasexualhealth.org\nSearch this site\nSearch this website\nCopyright \xc2\xa9\xc2\xa02020 \xc2\xb7 American Sexual Health Association'"

ASHA\xe2\x80\x99s Sexual Health TV is \xe2\x80\x9cmust see TV\xe2\x80\x9d for anyone who thinks they might need just a little help.\nFemale Condoms: A Woman-Centered Option\nIn honor of National Condom Month, ASHA asked our colleagues at the Center for Health and Gender Equity (CHANGE) to help us educate about female condoms. Kate Segal (Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Policy Analyst, Global Health Corps Fellow) and Beirne Roose-Snyder (Director of Public Policy) share their thoughts on this woman-centered contraceptive option.\nWhen women and girls dictate a prevention agenda, they account for their own unique prevention and pleasure needs that stem from their lived realities. What technologies exist that can both prevent unintended pregnancy and HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? Are these products easy to access? Do they make sense for women and girls\xe2\x80\x99 bodies? Do they feel good\xe2\x80\x94and maybe even enhance sex?\nWoman-centered contraceptive options, which are designed with these questions in mind, promote the right to a safe, full, and enjoyable sex life\xe2\x80\x94one where women and girls can make free and informed decisions about their sexuality without coercion, violence, or discrimination, through access to the information and interventions necessary for their sexual and reproductive health. Plus, sex can be pleasurable. Women and girls want and should have control over interventions that allow sex to be pleasurable for them while reducing unwanted or unintended outcomes.\nFemale condoms, also known as internal condoms, are one tool that achieves these objectives. They are the only dual-protection method designed for women to initiate that effectively protects against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and unintended pregnancy. They can be used by people of all genders who participate in receptive vaginal or anal sex. Studies have shown that female condoms have pregnancy1 and STI prevention2 rates comparable to male condoms.\nFemale condoms promote safety, particularly for women and girls. Unlike male condoms, female condoms can be inserted hours ahead of foreplay and intercourse. This feature provides women with options when they may not be able to safely negotiate male condom use, such as sex workers who are at risk of violence or whose clients refuse condom use3, or women who experience intimate partner violence.\nFor women living with HIV, female condoms are vital to their health and the health of their sexual partners, as they protect compromised immune systems from STIs and decrease the per-act probability of HIV transmission by over 90 percent.4\nWith the spread of the Zika epidemic, U.S. agencies have recommended including female condoms in Zika virus prevention efforts. While many people in Zika-affected countries know that the Zika virus is spread by mosquitoes, fewer are aware that the Zika virus is also sexually transmissible. Female condoms simultaneously prevent the sexual transmission of the Zika virus, including for pregnant women, and unintended pregnancies for women at risk of contracting Zika.\nIn addition to practical, female condoms are pleasurable. The outer ring of the condom covers the labia, which can lead to extra stimulation while reducing the risk of transmitting skin-to-skin STIs. Female condoms serve as an essential resource for women to plan pregnancies and have safe, healthy, and enjoyable sex.5\nWhile female condoms should be made widely available among a comprehensive array of contraceptive methods, they face multiple barriers to access. Uptake of female condoms can be difficult to generate due to their unfamiliarity and misuse. According to a 2005 study by the Guttmacher Institute, the female condom slipped out the first time for 11 percent of women. Educating women on how to insert female condoms is essential and empowering.\nAvailability of female condoms in the United States also remains limited. The FC2 is currently the only female condom brand approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But this could change soon. In December, the FDA proposed reclassifying the female condom to a \xe2\x80\x9cClass II medical device,\xe2\x80\x9d the same classification as the male condom. The government agency also recommended changing the name from \xe2\x80\x9cfemale\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cinternal.\xe2\x80\x9d Proponents argue that this move could broaden access to female condoms because they would not need pre-market approval.\nGlobally, female condoms are often procured in smaller quantities along with male condoms by ministries of health and donor governments, without the necessary investment in programming and demand creation. Otherwise hindered by much of the same stigma and politicization as other aspects of women\xe2\x80\x99s sexual health, female condoms can thrive in environments with open discussion of their insertion and use, peer education, and ready access. After all, health commodities don\xe2\x80\x99t normalize themselves. With more work and investment in generating excitement around woman-centered options that recognize their diverse needs and experiences, women and girls will be empowered to decide what prevention means to them. Better, safer sex awaits.\nReferences\nJames Trussell, Contraceptive Efficacy, in CONTRACEPTIVE TECHNOLOGY 747, 750 (19th rev. ed., Robert Hatcher et al., eds., 2009).

Approximately 1 in 8 individuals in this age group have HSV-2, which is almost always experienced as a genital infection. Most individuals with genital herpes are undiagnosed and not aware they have the virus.\nHSV-1 prevalence also dropped during the same period, from 59% in 1999 to 48%. HSV-1 is typically experienced as an oral infection (cold sores) but research suggests HSV-1 is found with nearly half of all new genital herpes infections.\nThe data were collected as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and reported in Prevalence of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 and Type 2 in Persons Ages 14-49: United States, 2015-2016 (McQuillan et al).

It is the virus that causes AIDS. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. HIV can be transmitted through the blood, sexual fluids, or breast milk of an HIV-infected person.\nOver time, infection with HIV can weaken the immune system to the point that the system has difficulty fighting off certain infections. These types of infections are known as opportunistic infections. These infections are usually controlled by a healthy immune system, but they can cause problems or even be life-threatening in someone with AIDS.\nA blood test can determine if a person is infected with HIV. Too many people don\xe2\x80\x99t know they have HIV. In the United States, nearly 1.1 million people are living with HIV, and almost one in five don\xe2\x80\x99t know they are infected. Getting tested is the first step to finding out if you have HIV. If you have HIV, getting medical care and taking medicines regularly helps you live a longer, healthier life and also lowers the chances of passing HIV on to others.\nIf a person tests positive for HIV, it does not necessarily mean that the person has AIDS. A diagnosis of AIDS is made by a physician according to the CDC AIDS Case Definition. A person infected with HIV may receive an AIDS diagnosis after developing one of the CDC-defined AIDS indicator illnesses. A person with HIV can also receive an AIDS diagnosis on the basis of certain blood tests (CD4 counts) and may not have experienced any serious illnesses.\nFAQs\nWhere did HIV come from?There are many theories about the origin of HIV. The first known case was found in a blood sample collected from man from Kinshasha, Democratic Republic of Congo in 1959. Genetic analysis of this blood suggests that the origin of HIV came from a single strain of HIV-1 in the 1940s or 1950s. In the U.S. the virus is known to have existed since the mid 1970s. Symptoms of rare types of what are now known as opportunistic infections began manifesting themselves between 1979-1981. HIV was first isolated by scientists in 1983. The virus was at first called HTLV-III/LAV (human T-cell lymphotropic virus-type III/lymphadenopathy- associated virus) by an international scientific committee. This name was later changed to HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).\nWhat is AIDS?A diagnosis of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is made by a physician. An HIV-infected person may be diagnosed with AIDS if he or she meets certain clinical criteria. Criteria include becoming sick with an illness defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as an AIDS-indicator illness (illnesses that take advantage of the body\xe2\x80\x99s weakened immune system) and/or by taking a blood test that shows that the person\xe2\x80\x99s immune system is severely damaged.\nWhat are the symptoms of HIV?Most people infected with HIV do not know that they have become infected, because they do not feel ill immediately after infection. However, some people do experience a illness with fever, rash, joint pains and enlarged lymph nodes. If an immune reaction to HIV occurs, it usually takes place between 1 and 6 weeks after HIV infection has happened. A person with HIV may look healthy and feel good, but they can still pass the virus to you, especially during the initial infection period. You cannot tell if someone has HIV by just looking at them. The only way to determine whether HIV is present in a person\xe2\x80\x99s body is by testing.\nHow does HIV become AIDS?AIDS is a disease caused by HIV. HIV infects cells of the human immune system and destroys or impairs their function. Infection with this virus leads to slow destruction of a persons\xe2\x80\x99 immune system making them more susceptible to many kinds of infections. Once a person with HIV develops any one of a number of rare infections or cancers \xe2\x80\x93 tuberculosis, pneumonia, candidiases or tumors \xe2\x80\x93 they are said to have AIDS. This most often occurs 10-15 years after a person becomes infected with HIV.\nHow long does it take for HIV to cause AIDS?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), prior to 1996, scientists estimated that about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years after becoming infected. This time varied greatly from person to person and depended on many factors, including a person\xe2\x80\x99s health status and their health-related behaviors.\nSince 1996, the introduction of powerful anti-retroviral therapies has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. There are also other medical treatments that can prevent or cure some of the illnesses associated with AIDS, though the treatments do not cure AIDS itself. Because of these advances in drug therapies and other medical treatments, estimates of how many people will develop AIDS and how soon are being recalculated, revised, or are currently under study.\nHow common are HIV and AIDS?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 1 million persons in the United States are living with diagnosed or undiagnosed HIV/AIDS. CDC estimates there are over 41,000 new HIV infections in the United States each year.\nThe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that, since the beginning of the epidemic, almost 60 million people worldwide have been infected with HIV and 25 million people have died of HIV-related causes. UNAIDS estimates that about 33.4 million people worldwide were living with HIV in 2008.\nWho does HIV affect?There are various risk factors that make some people more at risk for contracting HIV than others. Most people, however, run some risk of contracting HIV as they share in one or more of the following risk factors:\nUnprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex\nEarly age of first sexual activity\xe2\x80\x94It is common for youth to engage in sexual activity before receiving information about HIV prevention\nHeterosexual sex\xe2\x80\x93Women and minorities are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection\nMen who have Sex with Men (MSM)\xe2\x80\x93Stigma and discrimination make it more difficult for MSM to access testing and counseling services\nSexually transmitted infection (STIs)\xe2\x80\x93The presence of other STIs can greatly increase the likelihood of HIV transmission\nUnprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex\nExchange sex for money\nSubstance abuse\xe2\x80\x94Chronic and intermittent substance users are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors while using. Injection drug users also run the risk of being infected by HIV while sharing unclean needles.\nPoverty\xe2\x80\x94Socioeconomic factors can directly and indirectly influence a person\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerability to HIV infection. For many people poverty prevents access to quality health care.\nOut-of-school youth\xe2\x80\x94Those that drop out of school are more likely to become sexually active younger and less likely to use condoms and other types of contraception.\nLack of awareness\xe2\x80\x94Many people, particularly youth, don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize the ways in which they are vulnerable to HIV infection, making them more likely to behave in ways that put them at risk.\nHow safe is the U.S. blood supply?The U.S. blood supply is one of the safest in the world. Infection through blood transfusion and other blood products is rare. Since 1985, the blood supply has been ELISA tested for HIV. According to the CDC, an estimated 1 in 450,000 to 1 in 660,000 donations per year are infectious for HIV but are not detected by current antibody screening tests. In 1995, blood banks also began testing with P24 tests along with ELISA, to detect infection with HIV during this window period. As technology advances, the blood supply will become even safer.\nHow is HIV transmitted?HIV can be transmitted through the blood, sexual fluids (semen, preseminal fluid, or vaginal fluid) or breast milk of an HIV-infected person. People can get HIV one of these fluids enters the body by way of the mucous membranes (the soft, moist skin found in any opening of the body) or the bloodstream. The virus can be passed during unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex with a HIV-infected person. An HIV-infected mother can transmit HIV to her infant during pregnancy, delivery or while breastfeeding. People can also become infected with HIV when using injection drugs through sharing needles and other equipment (or works) including cookers and cottons with someone who is infected.\nThe risk of transmission varies with the type of exposure (e.g. sexual, needle sharing, etc.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a table quantifying the this HIV transmission risk that comes from different types of exposures. See the table and explanation at the CDC website.\nHow effective are latex condoms at preventing HIV?Studies have been done to test how well latex condoms work for preventing HIV transmission. This research has shown that latex condoms are highly effective at protecting a person from transmitting or becoming infected with the virus. The studies were done on HIV-negative individuals at high-risk for the disease because there partners were HIV-positive. Latex condoms used consistently and correctly were effective 98-100% of the time.\nWhile not having sex or to having sex with a long-term mutually monogamous partner who is not infected with HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is the only way to protect yourself completely, latex condoms used consistently and correctly are highly effective in preventing HIV and many other STIs.\nCan I get HIV from casual contact? HIV is not transmitted by day-to-day contact in social settings, schools or in the workplace. You cannot be infected by shaking someone\xe2\x80\x99s hand, by hugging someone, by using the same toilet or drinking from the same glass as an HIV-positive person, playing sports with or by being exposed to coughing or sneezing by anyone living with HIV. There is no evidence that HIV is spread through kissing. So you should not be fearful of interacting with persons who are living with the disease.\nFebruary is National Condom Month\nASHA recognizes each February as National Condom Month.

FAQs, posters, videos, and more. Get the facts and take control of your sexual health. #CondomMonth\nCondoms Unfurled\nNational Condom Month is always my favorite blog of the year to write. The condom. All sorts of shapes, sizes, colors (even glow-in-the-dark). Ribbed or plain. Lubed or not. Latex or plastic (and natural skin, although that variety isn\xe2\x80\x99t as effective as the others against sexually transmitted infections). Now we even have female condoms, amazing products that are a female-controlled method of contraception one can even insert several hours ahead of having sex.\nWhen I was a teen, my fellow adolescent wise-guys and I were a bit awed by condoms. They were serious business back in the day; simply possessing one conferred a certain level of credibility. They were kind of scary, too, a foil-wrapped reminder that we were taking our first steps into the world of adults and serious stuff. You were never quite sure how to use one, despite the best efforts of the basketball coach who was co-opted into double duty as the generic \xe2\x80\x9chealth\xe2\x80\x9d teacher (which resulted in the Commonwealth of Virginia entrusting him with our school\xe2\x80\x99s fledgling sex ed curriculum for boys. I think he taught driver\xe2\x80\x99s ed one semester, too).\nCondoms were exotic, mysterious, and, as I mentioned, a bit intimidating: come on, does anyone really need to unroll one all the way? They were ABSOLUTELY hidden from our parents, too, with the same level of Top Secret access usually assigned to a pack of smokes or a purloined copy of Playboy.\nThat latter point was a problem, of course, and I suspect it\xe2\x80\x99s not altogether different today. Given how many teens are sexually active (CDC data says 41% of high school students have had sex), how often they don\xe2\x80\x99t use protection (the same data says about 43% of kids who had sex in the last few months didn\xe2\x80\x99t use a condom), and the fact that sexually transmitted infections are rampant in young people (half of all STIs occur in youth\xe2\x80\xa6.HALF!) it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we put condoms in a distinguished front and center, full-view position.\nCondoms are inexpensive, easy to find, not hard to use (a little instruction never hurts, though!) and really, really effective against HIV, chlamydia and a host of other STIs when used \xe2\x80\x93 as the public health mantra goes- consistently and correctly. Not a bad choice against unintended pregnancy, either.\nParents: Your kids won\xe2\x80\x99t have sex because they learn about condoms (trust me, they\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out about sex regardless) but with your guidance, they can learn how to protect themselves when they do become sexually active. Sure, you\xe2\x80\x99re nervous, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the easiest thing to discuss, and I get it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry \xe2\x80\x93 do your best, be genuine, let them know they can talk to you about anything (including sex) and tell them about condoms. ASHA has a parent\xe2\x80\x99s guide to help you have the birds & bees talk, too.\nEverybody else: Did I mention condoms work? They do! Use them, admire them, give them to your best buds, and take them seriously.\nWe have loads of great resources for you during National Condom Month, so visit us for condom do\xe2\x80\x99s and don\xe2\x80\x99ts, videos, talking points if your partner is reluctant, and much more.\n\xe2\x80\x93Fred Wyand\nHad a Positive Experience with Female Condoms? Tell Us About It!\nFebruary is National Condom Month, a time when ASHA celebrates all things condom. While the male condom is well known as a reliable method to prevent both sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy, its not the only tool that can do so. The female condom offers women the advantage of a form of contraception and STI prevention that she can control.\nDuring condom month, we want to learn more about women\xe2\x80\x99s positive experiences with the female condom. While no one contraceptive is the right choice for everyone, many women (and men) prefer the female condom above other options. We want to hear from female condom users and share your feedback with others. Just type your comments below and hit \xe2\x80\x9cDone.\xe2\x80\x9d Comments are totally anonymous and will be shared on the ASHA site during Condom Month.\npowered by\nUnderstanding Women\xe2\x80\x99s Experiences with Bacterial Vaginosis\nBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common gynecologic infection, affecting nearly 29 percent of women in the U.S. While not all women with BV have symptoms, those that do may experience an abnormal vaginal discharge that may be white or gray, watery, and may also have a strong fish-like odor, or vaginal itching and irritation.\nLeft undiagnosed and untreated, BV can increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. BV also increases the risk of pre-term birth and low birth weight, which can negatively impact the overall health of the baby; and pelvic inflammatory disease. BV can impact women\xe2\x80\x99s emotional health as well, causing feelings of anxiety and embarrassment that can interfere with intimate relationships.\nTo get a better understanding of women\xe2\x80\x99s experiences with BV, ASHA, in conjunction with Harris Poll, conducted a national survey of 304 women ages 18 to 49 who have had BV. Key findings from the survey include:\n76 percent of women with BV stated they would have gone to see a healthcare professional sooner if they were aware of the risks associated with BV if left untreated.\nOnly 43 percent of women with BV are aware that if left untreated, BV can cause an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\nNot only did 62 percent of women mistake BV for a yeast infection prior to diagnosis, but 20 percent still believe that BV is a yeast infection\nMost women with BV feel self-conscious (68 percent) and/or embarrassed (66 percent) due to their condition\nWomen with BV admit that they have avoided certain everyday activities that may often be taken for granted, including being intimate with their spouse/partner (79 percent), working out (27 percent), or going on a first date (17 percent)\nThese survey results reaffirm the common misperceptions about BV and impact the condition can have on women\xe2\x80\x99s health. A new online resource, KeepHerAwesome.com, features more results from the survey and provides women and healthcare professionals with information on BV including a BV fact sheet, discussion guides on how to talk with your partner and healthcare provider about BV, and \xe2\x80\x9cDos and Don\xe2\x80\x99ts\xe2\x80\x9d for providers to share with their patients.\nThe survey was conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Symbiomix Therapeutics, LLC, a Lupin Company, and the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) within the United States between September 14 and 29, 2017 among 304 US women aged 18-49 who have been diagnosed by a healthcare professional with bacterial vaginosis (BV) within the past 2 years (\xe2\x80\x9cwomen with bacterial vaginosis\xe2\x80\x9d). Figures for age, income, race/ethnicity, region, education, and size of household were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population.\nA Three-Part Conversation with Dr. Pepper Schwartz on Female Sexual Difficulties\nFemale sexual difficulties are more common than you think and impact couples inside and outside the bedroom.

If you are sexually active and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get pregnant, you can explore the range of contraceptive choices available.\nYou can download our birth control method comparison chart and print out a copy to bring to your healthcare provider, so your provider can help you make the choice that\xe2\x80\x99s best for you.\nYou can begin protecting your fertility well before you are ready to start a family. Nutrition, a healthy lifestyle and decisions about sexual behavior influence a person\xe2\x80\x99s ability to conceive a child and a woman\xe2\x80\x99s ability have a safe delivery. In the ideal situation\xe2\x80\xa6 You will be able to:\nChoose if and when you want to conceive a child\nBiologically conceive a child\n(For women) Deliver a healthy infant\nMost people don\xe2\x80\x99t realize that their reproductive health system is the most fragile system in the body. You need to know how to protect your future fertility. The decisions you make as a young person can affect your ability to have children later in life. By engaging in unprotected sex, you put yourself at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women.\nWhat women need to know\nSTIs can have an impact on your ability to have children. When STIs go untreated they can cause fertility problems, particularly in women. For example:\nChlamydia and gonorrhea: Fifteen percent of all American women who are infertile can attribute it to tubal damage caused by pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes and other reproductive organs. It often results from untreated STD/STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. PID can lead to serious consequences that affect a woman\xe2\x80\x99s ability to have a baby, her experience during pregnancy and delivery, and the well being of her newborn.\nGenital herpes: Herpes is not uncommon among women. It\xe2\x80\x99s can be thought of as a skin infection of the mouth and/or genitals, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t usually have severe health consequences. The herpes virus stays in your body forever but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t usually interfere with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s ability to become pregnant. In rare circumstances, however, herpes infections can affect the well being of the newborn infant. For this reason women who are thinking about becoming pregnant or are already pregnant should talk with their doctors about protecting their baby.\nHIV: It is recommended that all pregnant women get tested before their baby is born. While routine testing for all populations is important to prevent the spread of HIV, it is especially important for expectant mothers. HIV can be passed between a mother and child during labor, and later through breastfeeding. By testing in advance, women and their doctors can create plans to protect the well being of their unborn children. Through medical treatments during delivery and feeding practices thereafter, HIV positive pregnant women can have HIV negative children.\nWhat you can do to protect yourself and your fertility:\nUse condoms correctly and consistently every time you have sex.\nLimit the number of sexual partners you have.\nGet an annual physical where you request annual chlamydia and gonorrhea screenings (strongly recommended for women 25 and under).\nGet tested and ask your sexual partners to get tested (before you start having sex!)\nRecognize when you are in an abusive relationship and know who to call.\nHepatitis B Virus: Five Things to Know\nHepatitis B is a virus that causes inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can be experienced as an \xe2\x80\x9cacute\xe2\x80\x9d infection causing mild illness for a few weeks or months or as a more serious \xe2\x80\x9cchronic\xe2\x80\x9d infection lasting a lifetime. Chronic HBV infection can cause complications such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and even lead to liver cancer.\nHepatitis B is More Common Than You Think\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates as many as 2.2 million persons in the U.S. are living with chronic hepatitis B.\nHepatitis B Is Most Commonly Transmitted Through Sexual Contact\nHepatitis B is transmitted through contact with infected body fluids such as semen, vaginal secretions, and blood. HBV is most often transmitted through sexual contact but can also be contracted when injecting drug users share needles and other injecting equipment. Mothers with HBV can also pass the virus to their infants during birth.\nBut Most Don\xe2\x80\x99t Know They Have It\nAdults often have few \xe2\x80\x93 if any- symptoms. When they occur, symptoms can be mistaken for the flu (nausea and vomiting, malaise, loss of appetite and abdominal pain). Some people with hepatitis B also experience jaundice, a yellowing of the eyes or skin.\nThe Only Way to Know is to Get Tested\nThe only way to know for sure is to test! Ask your health care provider if a test for HBV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are right for you. Special blood tests are used that can detect either HBV particles or antibodies (proteins in the blood your body produces against infections). Blood tests can determine if someone with hepatitis B has an acute or chronic infection.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s Easy to Prevent\nUse male or female condoms (sometimes called external or internal condoms) each time you have sex. While they don\xe2\x80\x99t provide 100% protection against hepatitis B and other STIs, when used consistently and correctly condoms are one of the best ways to reduce your risk for hepatitis B and other STIs. Those sharing households with someone diagnosed with HBV should contact with infected blood or other body fluids directly or on objects such as needles, razors, toothbrushes, and the like. Clean surfaces contaminated with blood or other body fluids with a solution of 1 part household bleach and 10 parts water.\nThere is a vaccine that can prevent hepatitis B! CDC recommends hepatitis B vaccination for sex partners of anyone who has hepatitis B; anyone who is sexually active but not in a long-term, monogamous relationship; those treated for STD/STIs; and men who have sex with men. Others may benefit from vaccination against HBV so ask your health care provider what is recommended for you.\nFor more on HBV and other STIs visit www.ASHAsexualhealth.org and follow us at #ISpeakSexHealth.\nUnderstanding LARC\nThe name says it all. Long-acting reversible contraception, or LARC, is reversible birth control that provides long-lasting (think years) pregnancy prevention. While not currently the leading choice among women, LARC use has been on the rise in recent years. In women aged 15-44, LARC use has grown from 1.5% in 2002 to 7.2% in 2011\xe2\x80\x932013. The rising popularity of LARC can likely be attributed to its high rate of effectiveness (more than 99 percent) and ease of use.\nLARC methods, which include intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants, are highly reliable\xe2\x80\x94research has shown LARC to be 20 times more effective than birth control pills, the patch, or the vaginal ring. One important reason why is the LARC removes the \xe2\x80\x9cuser error\xe2\x80\x9d factor that can make other methods less effective. No need to remember to take a pill daily, or have a diaphragm on hand ready to go. Once LARC is in place, it does its job for years with no input from the user at all, acting as a \xe2\x80\x9cset it and forget it\xe2\x80\x9d method.\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be forgotten\xe2\x80\x94protecting against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). While LARC is a highly effective way to prevent pregnancy, LARC methods don\xe2\x80\x99t prevent STIs. For this reason, many choose to use (and health professionals recommend) condoms in addition to a LARC method. Dual use of condoms and LARC thus offers couples dual prevention.\nASHA\xe2\x80\x99s Fred Wyand (a.k.a. Fredo) discusses\xc2\xa0dual use of LARC and condoms\xc2\xa0in the latest episode of ASHA Sex+Health podcast. Fred explains the facts about LARC and the added benefit of dual use of LARC and condoms to prevent STIs.\nLARC Methods\nThere are two LARC methods: the intrauterine device (IUD) and the birth control implant. The intrauterine device (IUD) was once a popular choice in the U.S., but following problems linked to the poorly designed Dalkon Shield model in the 1970s, usage dropped due to concerns about safety. The current newly designed models share none of the earlier safety concerns, but some misconceptions about this issue persist.\nThe birth control implant has been available in the United States since the 1990s. The earliest model, Norplant, included multiple rods implanted under the skin and offered pregnancy prevention for up to five years. Almost immediately after its approval, however, it became a target for misuse, as legislation was introduced in several states mandating its use in specific groups of women, including those receiving public assistance. Use of implants became an issue in the courts, as women facing charges including child and abuse and neglect were offered the option of accepting implants as condition of a reduced sentence.\nUnderstanding and acknowledging this history of coercive use of LARC and safety concerns is important, to avoid problems of the past. But so too is understanding the potential value of LARC methods today. The current concern with LARC is making sure women are well informed about these methods, including benefits and side effects, and making LARC an accessible and affordable option to all women.\nIUD: An IUD is a small T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus by a healthcare provider. It works by preventing sperm from fertilizing an egg. The hormonal type of IUD also thins the uterine lining, making it more difficult for a fertilized egg to implant.\nThere are two types of IUDs:\nHormonal IUD: This plastic IUD releases the hormone progestin. One type, Mirena, is approved for use for up to 5 years, while another, Skyla, is approved for use for up to 3 years.\nCopper IUD: The copper IUD, Paraguard, is hormone-free. It is approved for use for up to 10 years.\nWhile both types of IUDs can remain in place for years, they can also easily be removed if a woman decides she would like to become pregnant. Most women have no issues with the IUD, but problems can include spotting between periods, a heavier flow (with Paraguard), and back pains. Rare but serious problems can occur as well, and usually happen shortly after the IUD is inserted. These complications include the IUD falling out of the uterus, or piercing the uterine wall. Learn more about IUDs and hear stories from real women who use this method at Bedsider.\nImplant: The birth control implant is a single small, thin rod that is inserted under the skin of a women\xe2\x80\x99s upper arm by a healthcare provider. The rod releases the hormone progestin into the body, which both helps prevent ovulation and thickens cervical mucus, helping prevent sperm from reaching an egg. The implant prevents pregnancy for up to 3 years.\nAs with the IUD, the implant can be removed at any time if a woman decides to get pregnant. The most common side effect is irregular bleeding\xe2\x80\x94including spotting between periods and heavier periods. This typically improves over time. Learn more about implants and hear stories of women using this method at Bedsider.\nChoosing LARC\nSo with all the potential benefits, why is LARC not a more popular choice? One reason is the large upfront cost. Both methods must be inserted, and removed, by a physician and costs cannot be spread out over time as with other methods. However, under the Affordable Care Act, all insurance plans in the health insurance marketplace must cover all FDA-approved contraceptive methods prescribed by a woman\xe2\x80\x99s doctor, including LARC.\nAnother factor involves misconceptions about safety, even on the part of providers. In a 2012 study, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that nearly a third of healthcare providers had misconceptions about the safety of IUDs for women who have never had children. Such concerns are misplaced\xe2\x80\x94the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that LARC methods be offered as first-line birth control methods and encouraged as options for most women, including adolescents and women who have never had children.\nLARC offers women a safe, long-lasting choice for preventing pregnancy\xe2\x80\x94one that requires no real thought or effort over years. It\xe2\x80\x99s an option that most women should consider a viable choice.\nFeatured ASHA Ambassador: Irene Treadwell\nWe are so very pleased to shine a spotlight on Irene Treadwell as our featured ASHA ambassador!\nAn Ambassador since March 2017, Irene joined our ranks after finding out a colleague from Black Nurses Rock had become an ambassador. Black Nurses Rock is the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest minority nursing organization and sharing community with a huge social media presence and a mission to \xe2\x80\x9cinspire and empower innovative leaders that will serve and educate vulnerable communities.\xe2\x80\x9d Irene is the HIV/AIDS chair for the organization and says becoming a sexual health ambassador struck her as a great opportunity: \xe2\x80\x9cAs an ASHA ambassador, social media is key in getting your message out to the masses; irrespective of location, your message can reach the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAmbassadors find lots of surprises in their online interactions and Irene says the best part of being an ambassador is \xe2\x80\x9cgetting that thumbs up from folks you least expect, because you never know who\xe2\x80\x99s watching!\xe2\x80\x9d\nOne of her key messages is that sex and sexuality can flourish for as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re alive. \xe2\x80\x9cAs the U.S. population ages, we should focus on sexuality of folks throughout their lifespan, understanding the nuances of aging on the body and the importance of practicing safe sex at 20, at 50 and beyond.\xe2\x80\x9d We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree more and ASHA\xe2\x80\x99s website has a section devoted exclusively to Sex after 50.

Key findings from the most recent data include:\nAmong never-married teens in 2011-2015, 42% of females and 44% of males had sexual intercourse at least one time, similar to numbers from 2006-2010.\nIn 2011-2015 81% of female teens used some type of contraception when they first had intercourse, up from 74% in 2002. Male teens\xe2\x80\x99 use of condoms at first intercourse jumped from 71% in 2002 to nearly 77% in 2011-2015.\nEducating teens about sexual health is critical says ASHA president Lynn Barclay: \xe2\x80\x9cWhile these trends are encouraging we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t believe for a minute that the work is done. 20 million sexually transmitted infections occur each year in the U.S. and half are in youth ages 15-24.\xe2\x80\x9d Barclay says when it comes to educating young people, we need to focus on more than the physical aspects of sex. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does little good to tell a teen to \xe2\x80\x98use a condom\xe2\x80\x99 if they lack the skills or power to negotiate safer sex in a relationship. We need discussions around values, boundaries, gender differences and self-image. They all play a huge part in making healthy choices.\xe2\x80\x9d\nASHA has sexual health tools for health providers, parents, and educators along with an award-winning site for teens, iwannaknow.org.\nAbstinence-only Sex Ed 2.0?\nLong-time ASHA colleague Martha Kempner writes on rewire.com about recent key hires with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that may bolster the reemergence of abstinence-only sex education programs.\nMen\xe2\x80\x99s Sexual Health: Beyond the Carnal Tango\nThere are many misconceptions around men, sex, sexuality, and just what men want from relationships.

When looking only at women whose cervix is intact, the investigators found the corrected mortality rate for black women with cervical cancer is actually 10.1 per 100,000 compared to 5.7 per 100,000 with the uncorrected data that includes women who have had a total hysterectomy.\xc2\xa0 For white women, the corrected rate is 4.7 per 100,000 versus an uncorrected rate of 3.2.\nWithout the corrected figures, the authors say we\xe2\x80\x99re underestimating the true disparity between black and white women by a whopping 44%.\nThe authors say the racial differences likely stem from a variety of factors: compared to white women, black women have more barriers to health care and tend to be diagnosed with cervical cancer at a more advanced stage of disease (when the outcomes are poorer). They also note that differences in treatment may have a role, as black women with cervical cancer are at greater risk of inadequate care.\nThe American Cancer Society estimates there are approximately 13,000 total new cases of cervical cancer in the U.S. each year and about 4,000 deaths. ASHA president and CEO Lynn Barclay says the racial disparities are unacceptable and needless. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have the tools to prevent cervical cancer and let me be clear: not one single woman need die from this disease,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is heartbreaking that black women continue to suffer an unfair burden of cervical cancer mortality, and a national embarrassment that we\xe2\x80\x99re not developing and funding programs to make sure the most vulnerable communities get the care they need.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor more on preventing cervical cancer, including how to raise your voice and get involved, visit NCCC online.\nReference:\nBeavis, A.

Cancer. doi:\xc2\xa010.1002/cncr.30507.\nPrEP: HIV Prevention in a Pill\nWhen you think of HIV prevention, condoms are probably the first thing that comes to mind.\xc2\xa0 This is great as condoms are a proven method to reduce your risk of contracting HIV or other STIs during sexual intercourse. However, there is another option for those who may be at a higher risk for HIV- pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. PrEP involves taking a pill once daily to prevent HIV infection in someone who is HIV-negative. Two medications are currently approved by the FDA for PrEP and both combine drugs effective against HIV that are taken in one pill:\nTruvada\xc2\xae: approved in 2012 for all adults and adolescents with HIV risk\nDescovy\xc2\xae: approved in 2019 for many adults and adolescents at risk for HIV. Due to a lack of research, Descovy is not currently approved for use in those at risk for HIV through receptive vaginal sex.\nWhen taken consistently, every day, PrEP has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection in people who are at high risk by more than 90%.\nSo who is PrEP recommended for? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers these guidelines on people who should consider taking PrEP:\nAnyone who is in an ongoing relationship with someone who is HIV-positive.\nGay or bisexual men who have had anal sex without a condom or have been diagnosed with an STI in the past 6 months.\nHeterosexual men or women who do not regularly use condoms with partners with an unknown HIV status who are at substantial risk for HIV infections (e.g. people who inject drugs).\nPeople who have injected illicit drugs in the past 6 months and have shared injection equipment or have been in treatment for injection drug use in the past 6 months.\nWhile PrEP is recommended for different groups, it has received the most attention in the gay community. Gay and bisexual men are disproportionately affected by HIV: in 2013, they accounted for 81% estimated HIV diagnoses among all males aged 13 years and older and 65% of all persons receiving an HIV diagnosis that year. Given these alarming statistics, PrEP has been endorsed as an important prevention tool by a number of prominent activists and organizations, including the Human Rights Campaign, the Gay Men\xe2\x80\x99s Health Crisis, AIDS United, and the World Health Organization.\nHowever, PrEP has garnered some controversy as well. Among the criticisms is one that echoes the controversy that surrounds HPV vaccines\xe2\x80\x94the assumption that PrEP will lead to risky sexual behavior and promote promiscuity. But as with HPV vaccination, research has shown that such fears are unfounded. A study of the multinational iPrEx study that first established the effectiveness of a daily dose of Truvada to prevent HIV found \xe2\x80\x9cno evidence of risk compensation that would offset the benefits of PrEP.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, no evidence that taking PrEP led to risky sexual behavior. In fact, the reverse was true. As the study authors note, \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, participation in the study was associated with safer sexual behavior.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnother concern voiced is that PrEP will cause gay and bisexual men to abandon condoms, which have been a mainstay of HIV prevention efforts. But an analysis by CDC shows condom use on the declinebefore the approval of Truvada as PrEP in 2012. The CDC data indicate that in 2011, 57 percent of men who have sex with men reported having unprotected anal sex at least once in the previous 12 months, up from 48 percent in 2005. Given the decline in condom use, the availability of another prevention method should be welcomed.\nBut this not to suggest that PrEP replaces condoms. Far from it. Rather, PrEP offers a new option to those at high risk\xe2\x80\x94another tool in the HIV prevention toolbox that fits alongside condoms, not as a replacement. After all, while PrEP helps prevent HIV infection, condoms offer protection against a host of other STIs as well.\nDespite the promise offered by PrEP, it is necessarily the right choice for everyone. In addition to requiring taking a pill every day consistently, those on PrEP are also advised to see their healthcare provider regularly for follow up and get tested for HIV every 3 months. But for those willing to take on the commitment, PrEP offers the promise of a highly effective way to prevent HIV.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in PrEP and want to find a PrEP provider near you, check out our website sayyestoprep.org.\nLearn More about PrEP\nThe Advocate series \xe2\x80\x9c31 Days of PrEP\xe2\x80\x9d\nFAQs about PrEP from CDC\nBooklets from Project Inform\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs taking PrEP the right choice for you?\xe2\x80\x9d (for men and transgender women who have sex with men)\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrEP: A new option for women for safer loving\xe2\x80\x9d (for women who have sex with men)\nStories from men who explain why they take PrEP from the Advocate\nPrimary Sidebar#YESMEANSTEST\nDo It For Your Country!\nExpress Yourself\nIn the News\nSexually Transmitted Disease SurveillanceSweet Harmony: ACIP Updates HPV Vaccine Recommendations for Males and FemalesDesperate Housewives Star Talks about her Anal Cancer DiagnosisAccess Denied:\nAbortion Rights ThreatenedFDA Approves HPV Vaccine for Adults Over 26\nConnect with ASHA\nGet Involved\nTune In\nConnect with ASHA\nSecondary SidebarFooter Site Use and Privacy\nOnline Support Community\nSexual Health Glossary\nLinks to other sites\nContact Us\nContact Us\nASHA\nPO Box 13827\nResearch Triangle Park, NC 27709\n919.361.8400\ninfo@ashasexualhealth.org\nSearch this site\nSearch this website\nCopyright \xc2\xa9\xc2\xa02020 \xc2\xb7 American Sexual Health Association0'"

ASHA\xe2\x80\x99s Sexual Health TV is \xe2\x80\x9cmust see TV\xe2\x80\x9d for anyone who thinks they might need just a little help.\nFemale Condoms: A Woman-Centered Option\nIn honor of National Condom Month, ASHA asked our colleagues at the Center for Health and Gender Equity (CHANGE) to help us educate about female condoms. Kate Segal (Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Policy Analyst, Global Health Corps Fellow) and Beirne Roose-Snyder (Director of Public Policy) share their thoughts on this woman-centered contraceptive option.\nWhen women and girls dictate a prevention agenda, they account for their own unique prevention and pleasure needs that stem from their lived realities. What technologies exist that can both prevent unintended pregnancy and HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? Are these products easy to access? Do they make sense for women and girls\xe2\x80\x99 bodies? Do they feel good\xe2\x80\x94and maybe even enhance sex?\nWoman-centered contraceptive options, which are designed with these questions in mind, promote the right to a safe, full, and enjoyable sex life\xe2\x80\x94one where women and girls can make free and informed decisions about their sexuality without coercion, violence, or discrimination, through access to the information and interventions necessary for their sexual and reproductive health. Plus, sex can be pleasurable. Women and girls want and should have control over interventions that allow sex to be pleasurable for them while reducing unwanted or unintended outcomes.\nFemale condoms, also known as internal condoms, are one tool that achieves these objectives. They are the only dual-protection method designed for women to initiate that effectively protects against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and unintended pregnancy. They can be used by people of all genders who participate in receptive vaginal or anal sex. Studies have shown that female condoms have pregnancy1 and STI prevention2 rates comparable to male condoms.\nFemale condoms promote safety, particularly for women and girls. Unlike male condoms, female condoms can be inserted hours ahead of foreplay and intercourse. This feature provides women with options when they may not be able to safely negotiate male condom use, such as sex workers who are at risk of violence or whose clients refuse condom use3, or women who experience intimate partner violence.\nFor women living with HIV, female condoms are vital to their health and the health of their sexual partners, as they protect compromised immune systems from STIs and decrease the per-act probability of HIV transmission by over 90 percent.4\nWith the spread of the Zika epidemic, U.S. agencies have recommended including female condoms in Zika virus prevention efforts. While many people in Zika-affected countries know that the Zika virus is spread by mosquitoes, fewer are aware that the Zika virus is also sexually transmissible. Female condoms simultaneously prevent the sexual transmission of the Zika virus, including for pregnant women, and unintended pregnancies for women at risk of contracting Zika.\nIn addition to practical, female condoms are pleasurable. The outer ring of the condom covers the labia, which can lead to extra stimulation while reducing the risk of transmitting skin-to-skin STIs. Female condoms serve as an essential resource for women to plan pregnancies and have safe, healthy, and enjoyable sex.5\nWhile female condoms should be made widely available among a comprehensive array of contraceptive methods, they face multiple barriers to access. Uptake of female condoms can be difficult to generate due to their unfamiliarity and misuse. According to a 2005 study by the Guttmacher Institute, the female condom slipped out the first time for 11 percent of women. Educating women on how to insert female condoms is essential and empowering.\nAvailability of female condoms in the United States also remains limited. The FC2 is currently the only female condom brand approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But this could change soon. In December, the FDA proposed reclassifying the female condom to a \xe2\x80\x9cClass II medical device,\xe2\x80\x9d the same classification as the male condom. The government agency also recommended changing the name from \xe2\x80\x9cfemale\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cinternal.\xe2\x80\x9d Proponents argue that this move could broaden access to female condoms because they would not need pre-market approval.\nGlobally, female condoms are often procured in smaller quantities along with male condoms by ministries of health and donor governments, without the necessary investment in programming and demand creation. Otherwise hindered by much of the same stigma and politicization as other aspects of women\xe2\x80\x99s sexual health, female condoms can thrive in environments with open discussion of their insertion and use, peer education, and ready access. After all, health commodities don\xe2\x80\x99t normalize themselves. With more work and investment in generating excitement around woman-centered options that recognize their diverse needs and experiences, women and girls will be empowered to decide what prevention means to them. Better, safer sex awaits.\nReferences\nJames Trussell, Contraceptive Efficacy, in CONTRACEPTIVE TECHNOLOGY 747, 750 (19th rev. ed., Robert Hatcher et al., eds., 2009).

Approximately 1 in 8 individuals in this age group have HSV-2, which is almost always experienced as a genital infection. Most individuals with genital herpes are undiagnosed and not aware they have the virus.\nHSV-1 prevalence also dropped during the same period, from 59% in 1999 to 48%. HSV-1 is typically experienced as an oral infection (cold sores) but research suggests HSV-1 is found with nearly half of all new genital herpes infections.\nThe data were collected as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and reported in Prevalence of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 and Type 2 in Persons Ages 14-49: United States, 2015-2016 (McQuillan et al). NHANES is a series of continuing studies assessing the health of adults and children in the U.S.\nFor more on HSV including testing and prevention visit ASHA\xe2\x80\x99s Herpes Resource Center.\nFebruary 7th\nHIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. It is the virus that causes AIDS. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. HIV can be transmitted through the blood, sexual fluids, or breast milk of an HIV-infected person.\nOver time, infection with HIV can weaken the immune system to the point that the system has difficulty fighting off certain infections. These types of infections are known as opportunistic infections. These infections are usually controlled by a healthy immune system, but they can cause problems or even be life-threatening in someone with AIDS.\nA blood test can determine if a person is infected with HIV. Too many people don\xe2\x80\x99t know they have HIV. In the United States, nearly 1.1 million people are living with HIV, and almost one in five don\xe2\x80\x99t know they are infected. Getting tested is the first step to finding out if you have HIV. If you have HIV, getting medical care and taking medicines regularly helps you live a longer, healthier life and also lowers the chances of passing HIV on to others.\nIf a person tests positive for HIV, it does not necessarily mean that the person has AIDS. A diagnosis of AIDS is made by a physician according to the CDC AIDS Case Definition. A person infected with HIV may receive an AIDS diagnosis after developing one of the CDC-defined AIDS indicator illnesses. A person with HIV can also receive an AIDS diagnosis on the basis of certain blood tests (CD4 counts) and may not have experienced any serious illnesses.\nFAQs\nWhere did HIV come from?There are many theories about the origin of HIV. The first known case was found in a blood sample collected from man from Kinshasha, Democratic Republic of Congo in 1959. Genetic analysis of this blood suggests that the origin of HIV came from a single strain of HIV-1 in the 1940s or 1950s. In the U.S. the virus is known to have existed since the mid 1970s. Symptoms of rare types of what are now known as opportunistic infections began manifesting themselves between 1979-1981. HIV was first isolated by scientists in 1983. The virus was at first called HTLV-III/LAV (human T-cell lymphotropic virus-type III/lymphadenopathy- associated virus) by an international scientific committee. This name was later changed to HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).\nWhat is AIDS?A diagnosis of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is made by a physician. An HIV-infected person may be diagnosed with AIDS if he or she meets certain clinical criteria. Criteria include becoming sick with an illness defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as an AIDS-indicator illness (illnesses that take advantage of the body\xe2\x80\x99s weakened immune system) and/or by taking a blood test that shows that the person\xe2\x80\x99s immune system is severely damaged.\nWhat are the symptoms of HIV?Most people infected with HIV do not know that they have become infected, because they do not feel ill immediately after infection. However, some people do experience a illness with fever, rash, joint pains and enlarged lymph nodes. If an immune reaction to HIV occurs, it usually takes place between 1 and 6 weeks after HIV infection has happened. A person with HIV may look healthy and feel good, but they can still pass the virus to you, especially during the initial infection period. You cannot tell if someone has HIV by just looking at them. The only way to determine whether HIV is present in a person\xe2\x80\x99s body is by testing.\nHow does HIV become AIDS?AIDS is a disease caused by HIV. HIV infects cells of the human immune system and destroys or impairs their function. Infection with this virus leads to slow destruction of a persons\xe2\x80\x99 immune system making them more susceptible to many kinds of infections. Once a person with HIV develops any one of a number of rare infections or cancers \xe2\x80\x93 tuberculosis, pneumonia, candidiases or tumors \xe2\x80\x93 they are said to have AIDS. This most often occurs 10-15 years after a person becomes infected with HIV.\nHow long does it take for HIV to cause AIDS?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), prior to 1996, scientists estimated that about half the people with HIV would develop AIDS within 10 years after becoming infected. This time varied greatly from person to person and depended on many factors, including a person\xe2\x80\x99s health status and their health-related behaviors.\nSince 1996, the introduction of powerful anti-retroviral therapies has dramatically changed the progression time between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. There are also other medical treatments that can prevent or cure some of the illnesses associated with AIDS, though the treatments do not cure AIDS itself. Because of these advances in drug therapies and other medical treatments, estimates of how many people will develop AIDS and how soon are being recalculated, revised, or are currently under study.\nHow common are HIV and AIDS?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 1 million persons in the United States are living with diagnosed or undiagnosed HIV/AIDS. CDC estimates there are over 41,000 new HIV infections in the United States each year.\nThe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that, since the beginning of the epidemic, almost 60 million people worldwide have been infected with HIV and 25 million people have died of HIV-related causes. UNAIDS estimates that about 33.4 million people worldwide were living with HIV in 2008.\nWho does HIV affect?There are various risk factors that make some people more at risk for contracting HIV than others. Most people, however, run some risk of contracting HIV as they share in one or more of the following risk factors:\nUnprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex\nEarly age of first sexual activity\xe2\x80\x94It is common for youth to engage in sexual activity before receiving information about HIV prevention\nHeterosexual sex\xe2\x80\x93Women and minorities are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection\nMen who have Sex with Men (MSM)\xe2\x80\x93Stigma and discrimination make it more difficult for MSM to access testing and counseling services\nSexually transmitted infection (STIs)\xe2\x80\x93The presence of other STIs can greatly increase the likelihood of HIV transmission\nUnprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex\nExchange sex for money\nSubstance abuse\xe2\x80\x94Chronic and intermittent substance users are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors while using. Injection drug users also run the risk of being infected by HIV while sharing unclean needles.\nPoverty\xe2\x80\x94Socioeconomic factors can directly and indirectly influence a person\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerability to HIV infection. For many people poverty prevents access to quality health care.\nOut-of-school youth\xe2\x80\x94Those that drop out of school are more likely to become sexually active younger and less likely to use condoms and other types of contraception.\nLack of awareness\xe2\x80\x94Many people, particularly youth, don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize the ways in which they are vulnerable to HIV infection, making them more likely to behave in ways that put them at risk.\nHow safe is the U.S. blood supply?The U.S. blood supply is one of the safest in the world. Infection through blood transfusion and other blood products is rare. Since 1985, the blood supply has been ELISA tested for HIV. According to the CDC, an estimated 1 in 450,000 to 1 in 660,000 donations per year are infectious for HIV but are not detected by current antibody screening tests. In 1995, blood banks also began testing with P24 tests along with ELISA, to detect infection with HIV during this window period. As technology advances, the blood supply will become even safer.\nHow is HIV transmitted?HIV can be transmitted through the blood, sexual fluids (semen, preseminal fluid, or vaginal fluid) or breast milk of an HIV-infected person. People can get HIV one of these fluids enters the body by way of the mucous membranes (the soft, moist skin found in any opening of the body) or the bloodstream. The virus can be passed during unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex with a HIV-infected person. An HIV-infected mother can transmit HIV to her infant during pregnancy, delivery or while breastfeeding. People can also become infected with HIV when using injection drugs through sharing needles and other equipment (or works) including cookers and cottons with someone who is infected.\nThe risk of transmission varies with the type of exposure (e.g. sexual, needle sharing, etc.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a table quantifying the this HIV transmission risk that comes from different types of exposures. See the table and explanation at the CDC website.\nHow effective are latex condoms at preventing HIV?Studies have been done to test how well latex condoms work for preventing HIV transmission. This research has shown that latex condoms are highly effective at protecting a person from transmitting or becoming infected with the virus. The studies were done on HIV-negative individuals at high-risk for the disease because there partners were HIV-positive. Latex condoms used consistently and correctly were effective 98-100% of the time.\nWhile not having sex or to having sex with a long-term mutually monogamous partner who is not infected with HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is the only way to protect yourself completely, latex condoms used consistently and correctly are highly effective in preventing HIV and many other STIs.\nCan I get HIV from casual contact? HIV is not transmitted by day-to-day contact in social settings, schools or in the workplace. You cannot be infected by shaking someone\xe2\x80\x99s hand, by hugging someone, by using the same toilet or drinking from the same glass as an HIV-positive person, playing sports with or by being exposed to coughing or sneezing by anyone living with HIV. There is no evidence that HIV is spread through kissing. So you should not be fearful of interacting with persons who are living with the disease.\nFebruary is National Condom Month\nASHA recognizes each February as National Condom Month.

The condom. All sorts of shapes, sizes, colors (even glow-in-the-dark). Ribbed or plain. Lubed or not. Latex or plastic (and natural skin, although that variety isn\xe2\x80\x99t as effective as the others against sexually transmitted infections). Now we even have female condoms, amazing products that are a female-controlled method of contraception one can even insert several hours ahead of having sex.\nWhen I was a teen, my fellow adolescent wise-guys and I were a bit awed by condoms. They were serious business back in the day; simply possessing one conferred a certain level of credibility. They were kind of scary, too, a foil-wrapped reminder that we were taking our first steps into the world of adults and serious stuff. You were never quite sure how to use one, despite the best efforts of the basketball coach who was co-opted into double duty as the generic \xe2\x80\x9chealth\xe2\x80\x9d teacher (which resulted in the Commonwealth of Virginia entrusting him with our school\xe2\x80\x99s fledgling sex ed curriculum for boys. I think he taught driver\xe2\x80\x99s ed one semester, too).\nCondoms were exotic, mysterious, and, as I mentioned, a bit intimidating: come on, does anyone really need to unroll one all the way? They were ABSOLUTELY hidden from our parents, too, with the same level of Top Secret access usually assigned to a pack of smokes or a purloined copy of Playboy.\nThat latter point was a problem, of course, and I suspect it\xe2\x80\x99s not altogether different today. Given how many teens are sexually active (CDC data says 41% of high school students have had sex), how often they don\xe2\x80\x99t use protection (the same data says about 43% of kids who had sex in the last few months didn\xe2\x80\x99t use a condom), and the fact that sexually transmitted infections are rampant in young people (half of all STIs occur in youth\xe2\x80\xa6.HALF!) it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we put condoms in a distinguished front and center, full-view position.\nCondoms are inexpensive, easy to find, not hard to use (a little instruction never hurts, though!) and really, really effective against HIV, chlamydia and a host of other STIs when used \xe2\x80\x93 as the public health mantra goes- consistently and correctly. Not a bad choice against unintended pregnancy, either.\nParents: Your kids won\xe2\x80\x99t have sex because they learn about condoms (trust me, they\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out about sex regardless) but with your guidance, they can learn how to protect themselves when they do become sexually active. Sure, you\xe2\x80\x99re nervous, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the easiest thing to discuss, and I get it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry \xe2\x80\x93 do your best, be genuine, let them know they can talk to you about anything (including sex) and tell them about condoms. ASHA has a parent\xe2\x80\x99s guide to help you have the birds & bees talk, too.\nEverybody else: Did I mention condoms work? They do! Use them, admire them, give them to your best buds, and take them seriously.\nWe have loads of great resources for you during National Condom Month, so visit us for condom do\xe2\x80\x99s and don\xe2\x80\x99ts, videos, talking points if your partner is reluctant, and much more.\n\xe2\x80\x93Fred Wyand\nHad a Positive Experience with Female Condoms? Tell Us About It!\nFebruary is National Condom Month, a time when ASHA celebrates all things condom. While the male condom is well known as a reliable method to prevent both sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy, its not the only tool that can do so. The female condom offers women the advantage of a form of contraception and STI prevention that she can control.\nDuring condom month, we want to learn more about women\xe2\x80\x99s positive experiences with the female condom. While no one contraceptive is the right choice for everyone, many women (and men) prefer the female condom above other options. We want to hear from female condom users and share your feedback with others. Just type your comments below and hit \xe2\x80\x9cDone.\xe2\x80\x9d Comments are totally anonymous and will be shared on the ASHA site during Condom Month.\npowered by\nUnderstanding Women\xe2\x80\x99s Experiences with Bacterial Vaginosis\nBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common gynecologic infection, affecting nearly 29 percent of women in the U.S. While not all women with BV have symptoms, those that do may experience an abnormal vaginal discharge that may be white or gray, watery, and may also have a strong fish-like odor, or vaginal itching and irritation.\nLeft undiagnosed and untreated, BV can increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. BV also increases the risk of pre-term birth and low birth weight, which can negatively impact the overall health of the baby; and pelvic inflammatory disease. BV can impact women\xe2\x80\x99s emotional health as well, causing feelings of anxiety and embarrassment that can interfere with intimate relationships.\nTo get a better understanding of women\xe2\x80\x99s experiences with BV, ASHA, in conjunction with Harris Poll, conducted a national survey of 304 women ages 18 to 49 who have had BV. Key findings from the survey include:\n76 percent of women with BV stated they would have gone to see a healthcare professional sooner if they were aware of the risks associated with BV if left untreated.\nOnly 43 percent of women with BV are aware that if left untreated, BV can cause an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\nNot only did 62 percent of women mistake BV for a yeast infection prior to diagnosis, but 20 percent still believe that BV is a yeast infection\nMost women with BV feel self-conscious (68 percent) and/or embarrassed (66 percent) due to their condition\nWomen with BV admit that they have avoided certain everyday activities that may often be taken for granted, including being intimate with their spouse/partner (79 percent), working out (27 percent), or going on a first date (17 percent)\nThese survey results reaffirm the common misperceptions about BV and impact the condition can have on women\xe2\x80\x99s health. A new online resource, KeepHerAwesome.com, features more results from the survey and provides women and healthcare professionals with information on BV including a BV fact sheet, discussion guides on how to talk with your partner and healthcare provider about BV, and \xe2\x80\x9cDos and Don\xe2\x80\x99ts\xe2\x80\x9d for providers to share with their patients.\nThe survey was conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Symbiomix Therapeutics, LLC, a Lupin Company, and the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA) within the United States between September 14 and 29, 2017 among 304 US women aged 18-49 who have been diagnosed by a healthcare professional with bacterial vaginosis (BV) within the past 2 years (\xe2\x80\x9cwomen with bacterial vaginosis\xe2\x80\x9d). Figures for age, income, race/ethnicity, region, education, and size of household were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population.\nA Three-Part Conversation with Dr. Pepper Schwartz on Female Sexual Difficulties\nFemale sexual difficulties are more common than you think and impact couples inside and outside the bedroom.

LARC methods, which include intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants, are highly reliable, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t prevent STIs. For this reason, many choose to use (and health professionals recommend) condoms in addition to a LARC method. Dual use of condoms and LARC thus offers couples dual prevention.\nASHA\xe2\x80\x99s Fred Wyand (a.k.a. Fredo) discusses dual use of LARC and condoms in the latest episode of ASHA Sex+Health podcast.

Classification of examinations and tests needed before IUD insertion\nFour IUDs are available in the United States, the copper-bearing IUD and three levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs (containing a total of either 13.5 mg or 52 mg levonorgestrel). Fewer than 1 woman out of 100 becomes pregnant in the first year of using IUDs (with typical use) (14). IUDs are long-acting, are reversible, and can be used by women of all ages, including adolescents, and by parous and nulliparous women. IUDs do not protect against STDs; consistent and correct use of male latex condoms reduces the risk for STDs, including HIV.\nInitiation of Cu-IUDs\nTiming\nThe Cu-IUD can be inserted at any time if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant (Box 2).\nThe Cu-IUD also can be inserted within 5 days of the first act of unprotected sexual intercourse as an emergency contraceptive. If the day of ovulation can be estimated, the Cu-IUD also can be inserted >5 days after sexual intercourse as long as insertion does not occur >5 days after ovulation.\nNeed for Back-Up Contraception\nNo additional contraceptive protection is needed after Cu-IUD insertion.\nSpecial Considerations\nAmenorrhea (Not Postpartum)\nTiming: The Cu-IUD can be inserted at any time if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant (Box 2).\nNeed for back-up contraception: No additional contraceptive protection is needed.\nPostpartum (Including After Cesarean Delivery)\nTiming: The Cu-IUD can be inserted at any time postpartum, including immediately postpartum (U.S. MEC 1 or 2) (Box 1), if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant (Box 2). The Cu-IUD should not be inserted in a woman with postpartum sepsis (e.g., chorioamnionitis or endometritis) (U.S. MEC 4).\nNeed for back-up contraception: No additional contraceptive protection is needed.\nPostabortion (Spontaneous or Induced)\nTiming: The Cu-IUD can be inserted within the first 7 days, including immediately postabortion (U.S. MEC 1 for first trimester abortion and U.S. MEC 2 for second trimester abortion). The Cu-IUD should not be inserted immediately after septic abortion (U.S. MEC 4).\nNeed for back-up contraception: No additional contraceptive protection is needed.\nSwitching from Another Contraceptive Method\nTiming: The Cu-IUD can be inserted immediately if it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant (Box 2). Waiting for her next menstrual period is unnecessary.\nNeed for back-up contraception: No additional contraceptive protection is needed.\nComments and Evidence Summary. In situations in which the health care provider is not reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant, the woman should be provided with another contraceptive method to use until the health care provider can be reasonably certain that she is not pregnant and can insert the Cu-IUD.\nA systematic review identified eight studies that suggested that timing of Cu-IUD insertion in relation to the menstrual cycle in non-postpartum women had little effect on long-term outcomes (rates of continuation, removal, expulsion, or pregnancy) or on short-term outcomes (pain at insertion, bleeding at insertion, or immediate expulsion) (43) (Level of evidence: II-2, fair, direct).\nTop of Page\nExaminations and Tests Needed Before Initiation of a Cu-IUD or an LNG-IUDAmong healthy women, few examinations or tests are needed before initiation of an IUD (Table 1). Bimanual examination and cervical inspection are necessary before IUD insertion. A baseline weight and BMI measurement might be useful for monitoring IUD users over time. If a woman has not been screened for STDs according to STD screening guidelines, screening can be performed at the time of insertion. Women with known medical problems or other special conditions might need additional examinations or tests before being determined to be appropriate candidates for a particular method of contraception. U.S. MEC might be useful in such circumstances (5).\nComments and Evidence Summary. Weight (body mass index [BMI]): Obese women can use IUDs (U.S. MEC 1) (5); therefore, screening for obesity is not necessary for the safe initiation of IUDs. However, measuring weight and calculating BMI (weight [kg] / height [m]2) at baseline might be helpful for monitoring any changes and counseling women who might be concerned about weight change perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method.\nBimanual examination and cervical inspection: Bimanual examination and cervical inspection are necessary before IUD insertion to assess uterine size and position and to detect any cervical or uterine abnormalities that might indicate infection or otherwise prevent IUD insertion (44,45).\nSTDs: Women should be routinely screened for chlamydial infection and gonorrhea according to national screening guidelines. The CDC Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines provide information on screening eligibility, timing, and frequency of screening and on screening for persons with risk factors (15) (https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment). If STD screening guidelines have been followed, most women do not need additional STD screening at the time of IUD insertion. If a woman has not been screened according to guidelines, screening can be performed at the time of IUD insertion and insertion should not be delayed. If a woman with risk factors for STDs has not been screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia according to CDC STD treatment guidelines, screening can be performed at the time of IUD insertion, and insertion should not be delayed. Women with current purulent cervicitis or chlamydial infection or gonorrhea should not undergo IUD insertion (U.S. MEC 4). A systematic review identified two studies that demonstrated no differences in PID rates among women who screened positive for gonorrhea or chlamydia and underwent concurrent IUD insertion compared with women who screened positive and initiated other contraceptive methods (46). Indirect evidence demonstrates women who undergo same-day STD screening and IUD insertion have similar PID rates compared with women who have delayed IUD insertion. Women who undergo same-day STD screening and IUD insertion have low incidence rates of PID. Algorithms for predicting PID among women with risk factors for STDs have poor predictive value. Risk for PID among women with risk factors for STDs is low (15,47\xe2\x80\x9357). Although women with STDs at the time of IUD insertion have a higher risk for PID, the overall rate of PID among all IUD users is low (51,54).\nHemoglobin: Women with iron-deficiency anemia can use the LNG-IUD (U.S. MEC 1) (5); therefore, screening for anemia is not necessary for safe initiation of the LNG-IUD. Women with iron-deficiency anemia generally can use Cu-IUDs (U.S. MEC 2) (5). Measurement of hemoglobin before initiation of Cu-IUDs is not necessary because of the minimal change in hemoglobin among women with and without anemia using Cu-IUDs. A systematic review identified four studies that provided direct evidence for changes in hemoglobin among women with anemia who received Cu-IUDs (58). Evidence from one randomized trial (59) and one prospective cohort study (60) showed no significant changes in hemoglobin among Cu-IUD users with anemia, whereas two prospective cohort studies (61,62) showed a statistically significant decrease in hemoglobin levels during 12 months of follow-up; however, the magnitude of the decrease was small and most likely not clinically significant. The systematic review also identified 21 studies that provided indirect evidence by examining changes in hemoglobin among healthy women receiving Cu-IUDs (63\xe2\x80\x9383), which generally showed no clinically significant changes in hemoglobin levels with up to 5 years of follow-up (Level of evidence: I to II-2, fair, direct).\nLipids: Screening for dyslipidemias is not necessary for the safe initiation of Cu-IUD or LNG-IUD because of the low prevalence of undiagnosed disease in women of reproductive age and the low likelihood of clinically significant changes with use of hormonal contraceptives. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with lipid measurement before initiation of hormonal contraceptives (57). During 2009\xe2\x80\x932012 among women aged 20\xe2\x80\x9344 years in the United States, 7.6% had high cholesterol, defined as total serum cholesterol \xe2\x89\xa5240 mg/dL (84). During 1999\xe2\x80\x932008, the prevalence of undiagnosed hypercholesterolemia among women aged 20\xe2\x80\x9344 years was approximately 2% (85). Studies have shown mixed results about the effects of hormonal methods on lipid levels among both healthy women and women with baseline lipid abnormalities, and the clinical significance of these changes is unclear (86\xe2\x80\x9389).\nLiver enzymes: Women with liver disease can use the Cu-IUD (U.S. MEC 1) (5); therefore, screening for liver disease is not necessary for the safe initiation of the Cu-IUD. Although women with certain liver diseases generally should not use the LNG-IUD (U.S. MEC 3) (5), screening for liver disease before initiation of the LNG-IUD is not necessary because of the low prevalence of these conditions and the high likelihood that women with liver disease already would have had the condition diagnosed. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with liver enzyme tests before initiation of hormonal contraceptive use (57). In 2012, among U.S. women, the percentage with liver disease (not further specified) was 1.3% (90). In 2013, the incidence of acute hepatitis A, B, or C was \xe2\x89\xa41 per 100,000 U.S. population (91). During 2002\xe2\x80\x932011, the incidence of liver carcinoma among U.S. women was approximately 3.7 per 100,000 population (92). Because estrogen and progestins are metabolized in the liver, the use of hormonal contraceptives among women with liver disease might, theoretically, be a concern. The use of hormonal contraceptives, specifically COCs and POPs, does not affect disease progression or severity in women with hepatitis, cirrhosis, or benign focal nodular hyperplasia (93,94), although evidence is limited, and no evidence exists for the LNG-IUD.\nClinical breast examination: Women with breast disease can use the Cu-IUD (U.S. MEC 1) (5); therefore, screening for breast disease is not necessary for the safe initiation of the Cu-IUD. Although women with current breast cancer should not use the LNG-IUD (U.S. MEC 4) (5), screening asymptomatic women with a clinical breast examination before inserting an IUD is not necessary because of the low prevalence of breast cancer among women of reproductive age. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with a breast examination before initiation of hormonal contraceptives (95). The incidence of breast cancer among women of reproductive age in the United States is low. In 2012, the incidence of breast cancer among women aged 20\xe2\x80\x9349 years was approximately 70.7 per 100,000 women (96).\nCervical cytology: Although women with cervical cancer should not undergo IUD insertion (U.S. MEC 4) (5), screening asymptomatic women with cervical cytology before IUD insertion is not necessary because of the high rates of cervical screening, low incidence of cervical cancer in the United States, and high likelihood that a woman with cervical cancer already would have had the condition diagnosed. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with cervical cytology before initiation of IUDs (57). Cervical cancer is rare in the United States, with an incidence rate of 9.8 per 100,000 women during 2012 (96). The incidence and mortality rates from cervical cancer have declined dramatically in the United States, largely because of cervical cytology screening (97). Overall screening rates for cervical cancer in the United States are high; in 2013 among women aged 18\xe2\x80\x9344 years, approximately 77% reported having cervical cytology screening within the last 3 years (98).\nHIV screening: Women with HIV infection can use (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can use (U.S. MEC 2) IUDs (5). Therefore, HIV screening is not necessary before IUD insertion. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened for HIV infection before IUD insertion (57). Limited evidence suggests that IUDs are not associated with disease progression, increased infection, or other adverse health effects among women with HIV infection (99\xe2\x80\x93114).\nOther screening: Women with hypertension, diabetes, or thrombogenic mutations can use (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can use (U.S. MEC 2) IUDs (5). Therefore, screening for these conditions is not necessary for the safe initiation of IUDs.\nTop of Page\nProvision of Medications to Ease IUD Insertion\nMisoprostol is not recommended for routine use before IUD insertion. Misoprostol might be helpful in select circumstances (e.g., in women with a recent failed insertion).\nParacervical block with lidocaine might reduce patient pain during IUD insertion.\nComments and Evidence Summary. Potential barriers to IUD use include anticipated pain with insertion and provider concerns about difficult insertion. Identifying effective approaches to ease IUD insertion might increase IUD initiation.\nEvidence for misoprostol from two systematic reviews, including a total of 10 randomized controlled trials, suggests that misoprostol does not improve provider ease of insertion, reduce the need for adjunctive insertion measures, or improve insertion success (Level of evidence: I, good to fair, direct) and might increase patient pain and side effects (Level of evidence: I, high quality) (115,116). However, one randomized controlled trial examined women with a recent failed IUD insertion and found significantly higher insertion success with second insertion attempt among women pretreated with misoprostol versus placebo (Level of evidence: I, good, direct) (117).\nLimited evidence for paracervical block with lidocaine from one systematic review suggests that it might reduce patient pain (115). In this review, two randomized controlled trials found significantly reduced pain at either tenaculum placement or IUD insertion among women receiving paracervical block with 1% lidocaine 3\xe2\x80\x935 minutes before IUD insertion (118,119). Neither trial found differences in side effects among women receiving paracervical block compared with controls (Level of evidence: I, moderate to low quality) (118,119).\nLimited evidence on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and nitric oxide donors generally suggested no positive effect; evidence on lidocaine with administration other than paracervical block was limited and inconclusive (Level of evidence for provider ease of insertion: I, good to poor, direct; Level of evidence for need for adjunctive insertion measures: I, fair, direct; Level of evidence for patient pain: I, high to low quality; Level of evidence for side effects: I, high to low quality) (115,116).\nTop of Page\nProvision of Prophylactic Antibiotics at the Time of IUD Insertion\nProphylactic antibiotics are generally not recommended for Cu-IUD or LNG-IUD insertion.\nComments and Evidence Summary. Theoretically, IUD insertion could induce bacterial spread and lead to complications such as PID or infective endocarditis. A metaanalysis was conducted of randomized controlled trials examining antibiotic prophylaxis versus placebo or no treatment for IUD insertion (120). Use of prophylaxis reduced the frequency of unscheduled return visits but did not significantly reduce the incidence of PID or premature IUD discontinuation. Although the risk for PID was higher within the first 20 days after insertion, the incidence of PID was low among all women who had IUDs inserted (51). In addition, the American Heart Association recommends that the use of prophylactic antibiotics solely to prevent infective endocarditis is not needed for genitourinary procedures (121). Studies have not demonstrated a conclusive link between genitourinary procedures and infective endocarditis or a preventive benefit of prophylactic antibiotics during such procedures (121).\nTop of Page\nRoutine Follow-Up After IUD InsertionThese recommendations address when routine follow-up is needed for safe and effective continued use of contraception for healthy women. The recommendations refer to general situations and might vary for different users and different situations. Specific populations that might benefit from more frequent follow-up visits include adolescents, persons with certain medical conditions or characteristics, and persons with multiple medical conditions.\nAdvise a woman to return at any time to discuss side effects or other problems, if she wants to change the method being used, and when it is time to remove or replace the contraceptive method. No routine follow-up visit is required.\nAt other routine visits, health-care providers who see IUD users should do the following:\nAssess the woman\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction with her contraceptive method and whether she has any concerns about method use.\nAssess any changes in health status, including medications, that would change the appropriateness of the IUD for safe and effective continued use on the basis of U.S. MEC (e.g., category 3 and 4 conditions and characteristics).\nConsider performing an examination to check for the presence of the IUD strings.\nConsider assessing weight changes and counseling women who are concerned about weight changes perceived to be associated with their contraceptive method.\nComments and Evidence Summary. Evidence from a systematic review about the effect of a specific follow-up visit schedule on IUD continuation is very limited and of poor quality. The evidence did not suggest that greater frequency of visits or earlier timing of the first follow-up visit after insertion improves continuation of use (122) (Level of evidence: II-2, poor, direct). Evidence from four studies from a systematic review on the incidence of PID among IUD initiators, or IUD removal as a result of PID, suggested that the incidence of PID did not differ between women using Cu-IUDs and those using DMPA, COCs, or LNG-IUDs (123) (Level of evidence: I to II-2, good, indirect). Evidence on the timing of PID after IUD insertion is mixed. Although the rate of PID was generally low, the largest study suggested that the rate of PID was significantly higher in the first 20 days after insertion (51) (Level of evidence: I to II-3, good to poor, indirect).\nTop of Page\nBleeding Irregularities with Cu-IUD Use\nBefore Cu-IUD insertion, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during Cu-IUD use. Unscheduled spotting or light bleeding, as well as heavy or prolonged bleeding, is common during the first 3\xe2\x80\x936 months of Cu-IUD use, is generally not harmful, and decreases with continued Cu-IUD use.\nIf clinically indicated, consider an underlying gynecological problem, such as Cu-IUD displacement, an STD, pregnancy, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g., polyps or fibroids), especially in women who have already been using the Cu-IUD for a few months or longer and who have developed a new onset of heavy or prolonged bleeding. If an underlying gynecological problem is found, treat the condition or refer for care.\nIf an underlying gynecological problem is not found and the woman requests treatment, the following treatment option can be considered during days of bleeding:\nNonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for short-term treatment (5\xe2\x80\x937 days)\nIf bleeding persists and the woman finds it unacceptable, counsel her on alternative contraceptive methods, and offer another method if it is desired.\nComments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before insertion of the Cu-IUD, information about common side effects such as unscheduled spotting or light bleeding or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, especially during the first 3\xe2\x80\x936 months of use, should be discussed (64). These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been shown to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other contraceptives (i.e., DMPA) (124,125).\nEvidence is limited on specific drugs, doses, and durations of use for effective treatments for bleeding irregularities with Cu-IUD use; therefore, although this document includes general recommendations for treatments to consider, evidence for specific regimens is lacking.\nA systematic review identified 11 articles that examined various therapeutic treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding, prolonged menstrual bleeding, or both among women using Cu-IUDs (126). Nine studies examined the use of various oral NSAIDs for the treatment of heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding among Cu-IUD users and compared them to either a placebo or a baseline cycle. Three of these trials examined the use of indomethacin (127\xe2\x80\x93129), another three examined mefenamic acid (130\xe2\x80\x93132), and another three examined flufenamic acid (127,128,133). Other NSAIDs used in the reported trials included alclofenac (127,128), suprofen (134), and diclofenac sodium (135). All but one NSAID study (131) demonstrated statistically significant or notable reductions in mean total menstrual blood loss with NSAID use. One study among 19 Cu-IUD users with heavy bleeding suggested that treatment with oral tranexamic acid can significantly reduce mean blood loss during treatment compared with placebo (135). Data regarding the overall safety of tranexamic acid are limited; an FDA warning states that tranexamic acid is contraindicated in women with active thromboembolic disease or with a history or intrinsic risk for thrombosis or thromboembolism (136,137). Treatment with aspirin demonstrated no statistically significant change in mean blood loss among women whose pretreatment menstrual blood loss was >80 mL or 60\xe2\x80\x9380 mL; treatment resulted in a significant increase among women whose pretreatment menstrual blood loss was <60 mL (138). One study examined the use of a synthetic form of vasopressin, intranasal desmopressin (300 \xc2\xb5g/day), for the first 5 days of menses for three treatment cycles and found a significant reduction in mean blood loss compared with baseline (130) (Level of evidence: I to II-3, poor to fair, direct). Only one small study examined treatment of spotting with three separate NSAIDs and did not observe improvements in spotting in any of the groups (127) (Level of evidence: I, poor, direct).\nTop of Page\nBleeding Irregularities (Including Amenorrhea) with LNG-IUD Use\nBefore LNG-IUD insertion, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during LNG-IUD use. Unscheduled spotting or light bleeding is expected during the first 3\xe2\x80\x936 months of LNG-IUD use, is generally not harmful, and decreases with continued LNG-IUD use. Over time, bleeding generally decreases with LNG-IUD use, and many women experience only light menstrual bleeding or amenorrhea. Heavy or prolonged bleeding, either unscheduled or menstrual, is uncommon during LNG-IUD use.\nIrregular Bleeding (Spotting, Light Bleeding, or Heavy or Prolonged Bleeding)\nIf clinically indicated, consider an underlying gynecological problem, such as LNG-IUD displacement, an STD, pregnancy, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g., polyps or fibroids). If an underlying gynecological problem is found, treat the condition or refer for care.\nIf bleeding persists and the woman finds it unacceptable, counsel her on alternative contraceptive methods, and offer another method if it is desired.\nAmenorrhea\nAmenorrhea does not require any medical treatment. Provide reassurance.\nIf a woman\xe2\x80\x99s regular bleeding pattern changes abruptly to amenorrhea, consider ruling out pregnancy if clinically indicated.\nIf amenorrhea persists and the woman finds it unacceptable, counsel her on alternative contraceptive methods, and offer another method if it is desired\nComments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before insertion of the LNG-IUD, information about common side effects such as unscheduled spotting or light bleeding, especially during the first 3\xe2\x80\x936 months of use, should be discussed. Approximately half of LNG-IUD users are likely to experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea by 2 years of use (139). These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been shown to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other hormonal contraceptives (i.e., DMPA) (124,125). No direct evidence was found regarding therapeutic treatments for bleeding irregularities during LNG-IUD use.\nTop of Page\nManagement of the IUD when a Cu-IUD or an LNG-IUD User Is Found To Have PID\nTreat the PID according to the CDC Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines (15).\nProvide comprehensive management for STDs, including counseling about condom use.\nThe IUD does not need to be removed immediately if the woman needs ongoing contraception.\nReassess the woman in 48\xe2\x80\x9372 hours. If no clinical improvement occurs, continue antibiotics and consider removal of the IUD.\nIf the woman wants to discontinue use, remove the IUD sometime after antibiotics have been started to avoid the potential risk for bacterial spread resulting from the removal procedure.\nIf the IUD is removed, consider ECPs if appropriate. Counsel the woman on alternative contraceptive methods, and offer another method if it is desired.\nA summary of IUD management in women with PID is provided (Appendix F).\nComments and Evidence Summary. Treatment outcomes do not generally differ between women with PID who retain the IUD and those who have the IUD removed; however, appropriate antibiotic treatment and close clinical follow-up are necessary.\nA systematic review identified four studies that included women using copper or nonhormonal IUDs who developed PID and compared outcomes between women who had the IUD removed or did not (140). One randomized trial showed that women with IUDs removed had longer hospitalizations than those who did not, although no differences in PID recurrences or subsequent pregnancies were observed (141). Another randomized trial showed no differences in laboratory findings among women who removed the IUD compared with those who did not (142). One prospective cohort study showed no differences in clinical or laboratory findings during hospitalization; however, the IUD removal group had longer hospitalizations (143). One randomized trial showed that the rate of recovery for most clinical signs and symptoms was higher among women who had the IUD removed than among women who did not (144). No evidence was found regarding women using LNG-IUDs (Level of evidence: I to II-2, fair, direct).\nTop of Page\nManagement of the IUD when a Cu-IUD or an LNG-IUD User Is Found To Be Pregnant\nEvaluate for possible ectopic pregnancy.\nAdvise the woman that she has an increased risk for spontaneous abortion (including septic abortion that might be life threatening) and of preterm delivery if the IUD is left in place. The removal of the IUD reduces these risks but might not decrease the risk to the baseline level of a pregnancy without an IUD.\nIf she does not want to continue the pregnancy, counsel her about options.\nIf she wants to continue the pregnancy, advise her to seek care promptly if she has heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever.\nIUD Strings Are Visible or Can Be Retrieved Safely from the Cervical Canal\nAdvise the woman that the IUD should be removed as soon as possible.\nIf the IUD is to be removed, remove it by pulling on the strings gently.\nAdvise the woman that she should return promptly if she has heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever.\nIf she chooses to keep the IUD, advise her to seek care promptly if she has heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever.\nIUD Strings Are Not Visible and Cannot Be Retrieved Safely\nIf ultrasonography is available, consider performing or referring for ultrasound examination to determine the location of the IUD. If the IUD cannot be located, it might have been expelled or have perforated the uterine wall.\nIf ultrasonography is not possible or the IUD is determined by ultrasound to be inside the uterus, advise the woman to seek care promptly if she has heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever.\nComments and Evidence Summary. Removing the IUD improves the pregnancy outcome if the IUD strings are visible or the device can be retrieved safely from the cervical canal. Risks for spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and infection are substantial if the IUD is left in place.\nTheoretically, the fetus might be affected by hormonal exposure from an LNG-IUD; however, whether this exposure increases the risk for fetal abnormalities is unknown.\nA systematic review identified nine studies suggesting that women who did not remove their IUDs during pregnancy were at greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes (including spontaneous abortion, septic abortion, preterm delivery, and chorioamnion"

IUDs do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and women using these methods should be counseled that consistent and correct use of the male latex condom reduces the risk for transmission of HIV and other STDs. Use of female condoms can provide protection from transmission of STDs, although data are limited.\nBOX B1. Categories for Classifying Intrauterine Devices\n1 = A condition for which there is no restriction for the use of the contraceptive method.2 = A condition for which the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks.\n3 = A condition for which the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using the method.\n4 = A condition that represents an unacceptable health risk if the contraceptive method is used.\nTABLE B1.

Higher rates of expulsion during the postpartum period should be considered as they relate to effectiveness, along with patient access to interval placement (i.e., not related to pregnancy) when expulsion rates are lower.Clarification (breastfeeding): Breastfeeding provides important health benefits for mother and infant. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends increasing the proportion of infants initially breastfed, exclusively breastfed through 6 months of life, and continuing breastfeeding through at least 1 year of life as key public health goals (10).\nEvidence: Studies suggest that immediate postplacental (<10 minutes) and early postpartum (10 minutes up until 72 hours) placement of Cu-IUDs and LNG-IUDs is associated with increased risk for expulsion compared with interval placement (i.e., not related to pregnancy). Early postpartum placement has similar or increased risk for expulsion compared with immediate postplacental placement. Although immediate postplacental placement at the time of cesarean delivery might have increased risk for expulsion compared with interval placement, risk appears lower than that for placement at the time of vaginal delivery. Evidence for infection, perforation, and removals for pain or bleeding are limited; however, these events are rare (11\xe2\x80\x9362).\nEvidence (breastfeeding): Two randomized controlled trials found conflicting results on breastfeeding outcomes when LNG-IUDs were initiated immediately postpartum compared with 6\xe2\x80\x938 weeks postpartum. Initiation of LNG-IUDs immediately postpartum had no other harmful effect on infant health, growth, or development (63,64). Breastfeeding women using IUDs do not have an increased risk for certain IUD-related adverse events including expulsion, infection, pain, or bleeding compared with nonbreastfeeding women. The risk for perforation is increased independently among breastfeeding women and among women \xe2\x89\xa436 weeks postpartum, compared with non-postpartum women; however, the absolute risk for perforation remains low (11\xe2\x80\x9362,65).\nComment (breastfeeding): Certain women might be at risk for breastfeeding difficulties, such as women with previous breastfeeding difficulties, certain medical conditions, or certain perinatal complications and those who deliver preterm. For these women, as for all women, discussions about contraception for breastfeeding women should include information about risks, benefits, and alternatives.\ni. Breastfeeding\n1\n2\nii.

First trimester\n1\n1\nClarification: IUDs can be inserted immediately after spontaneous or induced abortion.\nEvidence: Risk for complications from immediate versus delayed insertion of an IUD after abortion did not differ. Expulsion was greater when an IUD was inserted after a second trimester abortion than when inserted after a first trimester abortion. Safety or expulsion for postabortion insertion of an LNG-IUD did not differ from that of a Cu-IUD (66).\nb. Second trimester\n2\n2\nc.

For all subconditions of SLE, classifications are based on the assumption that no other risk factors for cardiovascular disease are present; these classifications must be modified in the presence of such risk factors. Many women with SLE can be considered good candidates for most contraceptive methods, including hormonal contraceptives (73,77\xe2\x80\x9394).\nEvidence: Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with a higher risk for both arterial and venous thrombosis (95,96).\nb.

Many women with SLE can be considered good candidates for most contraceptive methods, including hormonal contraceptives (73,77\xe2\x80\x9394).\nClarification: Severe thrombocytopenia increases the risk for bleeding. The category should be assessed according to the severity of thrombocytopenia and its clinical manifestations. In women with very severe thrombocytopenia who are at risk for spontaneous bleeding, consultation with a specialist and certain pretreatments might be warranted.\nEvidence: The LNG-IUD might be a useful treatment for menorrhagia in women with severe thrombocytopenia (73).\nc.

Limited evidence demonstrated that women using LNG-IUDs do not have an increased risk for ischemic stroke compared with women not using hormonal contraceptives (98).Comment: Menstrual migraine is a subtype of migraine without aura. For more information see The International Headache Society Classification, 3rd edition (https://ichd-3.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/The-International-Classification-of-Headache-Disorders-3rd-Edition-2018.pdfpdf iconexternal icon).\nii.

Irregular pattern without heavy bleeding\n1\n1\n1\n\xe2\x80\x94\nb. Heavy or prolonged bleeding (includes regular and irregular patterns)\n2\n1\n2\nClarification: Unusually heavy bleeding should raise suspicion of a serious underlying condition.\nEvidence: Evidence from studies examining the treatment effects of the LNG-IUD among women with heavy or prolonged bleeding reported no increase in adverse effects and found the LNG-IUD to be beneficial in treating menorrhagia (100\xe2\x80\x93107).\nUnexplained vaginal bleeding\n(suspicious for serious condition) before evaluation\nInitiation\n4\nContinuation\n2\nInitiation\n4\nContinuation\n2\nClarification: If pregnancy or an underlying pathological condition (e.g., pelvic malignancy) is suspected, it must be evaluated and the category adjusted after evaluation. The IUD does not need to be removed before evaluation.\nEndometriosis\n2\n1\nEvidence: LNG-IUD use among women with endometriosis decreased dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and dyspareunia (108\xe2\x80\x93112).\nBenign ovarian tumors (including cysts)\n1\n1\n\xe2\x80\x94\nSevere dysmenorrhea\n2\n1\nComment: Dysmenorrhea might intensify with Cu-IUD use. LNG-IUD use has been associated with reduction of dysmenorrhea.\nGestational trophoblastic disease\nThis condition is associated with increased risk for adverse health events as a result of pregnancy (Box 2).\na. Suspected gestational trophoblastic disease (immediate postevacuation)\nClarification: For all subconditions of gestational trophoblastic disease, classifications are based on the assumption that women are under close medical supervision because of the need for monitoring of \xce\xb2-hCG levels for appropriate disease surveillance.Evidence: Limited evidence suggests that women using an IUD after uterine evacuation for a molar pregnancy are not at greater risk for postmolar trophoblastic disease than are women using other methods of contraception (113).\nComment: The risk for expulsion immediately postevacuation for gestational trophoblastic disease is unknown. Expulsion is greater after IUD insertion immediately postevacuation for a spontaneous or induced abortion in the second trimester compared with IUD insertion after a first trimester abortion.\ni.

These elements include safety, effectiveness, availability (including accessibility and affordability), and acceptability. Voluntary informed choice of contraceptive methods is an essential guiding principle, and contraceptive counseling, when applicable, might be an important contributor to the successful use of contraceptive methods.\nIn choosing a method of contraception, dual protection from the simultaneous risk for HIV and other STDs also should be considered. Although hormonal contraceptives and IUDs are highly effective at preventing pregnancy, they do not protect against STDs, including HIV. Consistent and correct use of the male latex condom reduces the risk for HIV infection and other STDs, including chlamydial infection, gonococcal infection, and trichomoniasis.\nReversible Methods of Birth Control\nIntrauterine Contraception\nCopper T intrauterine device (IUD) \xe2\x80\x94This IUD is a small device that is shaped in the form of a \xe2\x80\x9cT.\xe2\x80\x9d Your doctor places it inside the uterus to prevent pregnancy. It can stay in your uterus for up to 10 years. Typical use failure rate: 0.8%.1\nLevonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG IUD)\xe2\x80\x94The LNG IUD is a small T-shaped device like the Copper T IUD. It is placed inside the uterus by a doctor. It releases a small amount of progestin each day to keep you from getting pregnant. The LNG IUD stays in your uterus for up to 3 to 6 years, depending on the device. Typical use failure rate: 0.1-0.4%.1\nHormonal Methods\nImplant\xe2\x80\x94The implant is a single, thin rod that is inserted under the skin of a women\xe2\x80\x99s upper arm. The rod contains a progestin that is released into the body over 3 years. Typical use failure rate: 0.01%.1\nInjection or \xe2\x80\x9cshot\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Women get shots of the hormone progestin in the buttocks or arm every three months from their doctor. Typical use failure rate: 4%.1\nCombined oral contraceptives\xe2\x80\x94Also called \xe2\x80\x9cthe pill,\xe2\x80\x9d combined oral contraceptives contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. It is prescribed by a doctor. A pill is taken at the same time each day. If you are older than 35 years and smoke, have a history of blood clots or breast cancer, your doctor may advise you not to take the pill. Typical use failure rate: 7%.1\nProgestin only pill\xe2\x80\x94Unlike the combined pill, the progestin-only pill (sometimes called the mini-pill) only has one hormone, progestin, instead of both estrogen and progestin. It is prescribed by a doctor. It is taken at the same time each day. It may be a good option for women who can\xe2\x80\x99t take estrogen. Typical use failure rate: 7%.1\nPatch\xe2\x80\x94This skin patch is worn on the lower abdomen, buttocks, or upper body (but not on the breasts). This method is prescribed by a doctor. It releases hormones progestin and estrogen into the bloodstream. You put on a new patch once a week for three weeks. During the fourth week, you do not wear a patch, so you can have a menstrual period. Typical use failure rate: 7%.1\nHormonal vaginal contraceptive ring\xe2\x80\x94The ring releases the hormones progestin and estrogen. You place the ring inside your vagina. You wear the ring for three weeks, take it out for the week you have your period, and then put in a new ring. Typical use failure rate: 7%.1\nBarrier Methods\nDiaphragm or cervical cap\xe2\x80\x94Each of these barrier methods are placed inside the vagina to cover the cervix to block sperm. The diaphragm is shaped like a shallow cup. The cervical cap is a thimble-shaped cup. Before sexual intercourse, you insert them with spermicide to block or kill sperm. Visit your doctor for a proper fitting because diaphragms and cervical caps come in different sizes. Typical use failure rate for the diaphragm: 17%.1\nSponge\xe2\x80\x94The contraceptive sponge contains spermicide and is placed in the vagina where it fits over the cervix. The sponge works for up to 24 hours, and must be left in the vagina for at least 6 hours after the last act of intercourse, at which time it is removed and discarded. Typical use failure rate: 14% for women who have never had a baby and 27% for women who have had a baby.1\nMale condom\xe2\x80\x94Worn by the man, a male condom keeps sperm from getting into a woman\xe2\x80\x99s body. Latex condoms, the most common type, help prevent pregnancy, and HIV and other STDs, as do the newer synthetic condoms. \xe2\x80\x9cNatural\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9clambskin\xe2\x80\x9d condoms also help prevent pregnancy, but may not provide protection against STDs, including HIV. Typical use failure rate: 13%.1 Condoms can only be used once. You can buy condoms, KY jelly, or water-based lubricants at a drug store. Do not use oil-based lubricants such as massage oils, baby oil, lotions, or petroleum jelly with latex condoms. They will weaken the condom, causing it to tear or break.\nFemale condom\xe2\x80\x94Worn by the woman, the female condom helps keeps sperm from getting into her body. It is packaged with a lubricant and is available at drug stores. It can be inserted up to eight hours before sexual intercourse. Typical use failure rate: 21%,1 and also may help prevent STDs.\nSpermicides\xe2\x80\x94These products work by killing sperm and come in several forms\xe2\x80\x94foam, gel, cream, film, suppository, or tablet. They are placed in the vagina no more than one hour before intercourse. You leave them in place at least six to eight hours after intercourse. You can use a spermicide in addition to a male condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap. They can be purchased at drug stores. Typical use failure rate: 21%.1\nFertility Awareness-Based Methods\nFertility awareness-based methods\xe2\x80\x94Understanding your\xc2\xa0monthly fertility patternexternal icon can help you plan to get pregnant or avoid getting pregnant. Your fertility pattern is the number of days in the month when you are fertile (able to get pregnant), days when you are infertile, and days when fertility is unlikely, but possible. If you have a regular menstrual cycle, you have about nine or more fertile days each month. If you do not want to get pregnant, you do not have sex on the days you are fertile, or you use a barrier method of birth control on those days. Failure rates vary across these methods.1-2 Range of typical use failure rates: 2-23%.1\nLactational Amenorrhea Method\nFor women who have recently had a baby and are breastfeeding, the Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) can be used as birth control when three conditions are met: 1) amenorrhea (not having any menstrual periods after delivering a baby), 2) fully or nearly fully breastfeeding, and 3) less than 6 months after delivering a baby. LAM is a temporary method of birth control, and another birth control method must be used when any of the three conditions are not met.\nEmergency Contraception\nEmergency contraception is NOT a regular method of birth control. Emergency contraception can be used after no birth control was used during sex, or if the birth control method failed, such as if a condom broke.\nCopper IUD\xe2\x80\x94Women can have the copper T IUD inserted within five days of unprotected sex.\nEmergency contraceptive pills\xe2\x80\x94Women can take emergency contraceptive pills up to 5 days after unprotected sex, but the sooner the pills are taken, the better they will work. There are three different types of emergency contraceptive pills available in the United States. Some emergency contraceptive pills are available over the counter.\nPermanent Methods of Birth Control\nFemale Sterilization\xe2\x80\x94Tubal ligation or \xe2\x80\x9ctying tubes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 A woman can have her fallopian tubes tied (or closed) so that sperm and eggs cannot meet for fertilization. The procedure can be done in a hospital or in an outpatient surgical center. You can go home the same day of the surgery and resume your normal activities within a few days. This method is effective immediately. Typical use failure rate: 0.5%.1\nMale Sterilization\xe2\x80\x93Vasectomy\xe2\x80\x94This operation is done to keep a man\xe2\x80\x99s sperm from going to his penis, so his ejaculate never has any sperm in it that can fertilize an egg. The procedure is typically done at an outpatient surgical center. The man can go home the same day. Recovery time is less than one week. After the operation, a man visits his doctor for tests to count his sperm and to make sure the sperm count has dropped to zero; this takes about 12 weeks. Another form of birth control should be used until the man\xe2\x80\x99s sperm count has dropped to zero. Typical use failure rate: 0.15%.1\nReferences\nTrussell J, Aiken ARA, Micks E, Guthrie KA.

However, when the time of ovulation can be estimated, the Cu-IUD can be inserted beyond 5 days after intercourse, if necessary, as long as the insertion does not occur >5 days after ovulation. The eligibility criteria for interval Cu-IUD insertion also apply for the insertion of Cu-IUDs as emergency contraception (Box J1) (Table J1).\nClassifications for emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) are given for ulipristal acetate (UPA), levonorgestrel (LNG), and combined oral contraceptives (COCs). Cu-IUDs, UPA, LNG, and COCs do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and women using these methods should be counseled that consistent and correct use of the male latex condom reduces the risk for transmission of HIV and other STDs. Use of female condoms can provide protection from transmission of STDs, although data are limited.\nBOX J1. Categories for classifying emergency contraception\n1 = A condition for which there is no restriction for the use of the contraceptive method.2 = A condition for which the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks.\n3 = A condition for which the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using the method.\n4 = A condition that represents an unacceptable health risk if the contraceptive method is used.\nTABLE J1.

Mean UPA concentrations in breast milk decrease markedly from 0 to 24\xe2\x80\x9348 hours and then slowly decrease over 5 days (2). Breast milk should be expressed and discarded for 24 hours after taking UPA.\nEvidence: Breastfeeding outcomes do not seem to differ between women exposed to LNG and those who are not exposed.

According to CDC STD treatment guidelines, routine presumptive treatment of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas is recommended after sexual assault (3). Women with current purulent cervicitis or chlamydial infection or gonococcal infection should not undergo IUD insertion (category 4).\nObesity (BMI \xe2\x89\xa530 kg/m2)\n1\n2\n2\n2\nClarification (ECPs): ECPs might be less effective among women with BMI \xe2\x89\xa530 kg/m2 than among women with BMI <25 kg/m2. Despite this, no safety concerns exist.\nEvidence: Limited evidence from secondary data analyses suggests that women with BMI \xe2\x89\xa530 kg/m2 experience an increased risk for pregnancy after use of LNG compared with women with BMI <25 kg/m2. Two analyses suggest obese women might also experience an increased risk for pregnancy after use of UPA compared with nonobese women, although this increase was not significant in one study (4).\nCYP3A4 inducers (e.g., bosentan, carbamazepine, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John\xe2\x80\x99s wort, topiramate, efavirenz, and lumacaftor)\n1\n2\n2\n2\nClarification (ECPs): Strong CYP3A4 inducers might reduce the effectiveness of ECPs.\nEvidence: According to labelling information, rifampin markedly decreases UPA levels by \xe2\x89\xa590%, which might decrease its efficacy (2). Therefore, theoretical concerns extend to use of other CYP3A4 inducers as well as to COC and LNG ECPs, which have metabolic pathways similar to those of UPA. A small pharmacokinetic study found that concomitant efavirenz use decreased LNG levels in women taking LNG ECPs (0.75 mg) by 56% compared with LNG ECPs alone (5).\nAbbreviations: BMI = body mass index; CHC = combined hormonal contraceptive; COC = combined oral contraceptive; Cu-IUD = copper-containing intrauterine device; ECP = emergency contraceptive pill; HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; IUD = intrauterine device; LNG = levonorgestrel; NA = not applicable; POC = progestin-only contraceptive; POP = progestin-only pill; STD = sexually transmitted disease; UPA = ulipristal acetate.\nReferences\nJatlaoui TC, Riley H, Curtis KM.

LARC,"b'CURRENT TRENDS IUD SAFETY: REPORT OF A NATIONWIDE PHYSICIAN SURVEY\nWeekly\nOctober 17, 1997 / 46(41);969-974\nPersons using assistive technology might not be able to fully access information in this file. For assistance, please send e-mail to: mmwrq@cdc.gov. Type 508 Accommodation and the title of the report in the subject line of e-mail.\nCURRENT TRENDS IUD SAFETY: REPORT OF A NATIONWIDE PHYSICIAN SURVEY\nAs part of its continuing commemoration of CDC\'s 50th\nanniversary in July 1996, MMWR is reprinting selected MMWR articles\nof historical interest to public health, accompanied by current\neditorial notes. Reprinted below is the report published June 29,\n1974, that documented an association between the use of the Dalkon\nShield intrauterine device and increased incidence of complicated\npregnancies in women.\nIn an attempt to determine the morbidity and mortality\nassociated with IUD use nationwide, the Family Planning Evaluation\nDivision, CDC, in conjunction with the Committee on Maternal and\nChild Care of the American Medical Association (AMA) and the\nAmerican Osteopathic Association (AOA), began a physician survey in\nJune 1973.\nFrom their master files, AMA and AOA provided the names of\n34,544 physicians in the United States and Puerto Rico - virtually\nall physicians who had a primary, secondary, or tertiary interest\nin obstetrics or gynecology, or a primary interest in family\npractice, public health, or general preventive medicine. In the\nlast week of June 1973, CDC sent a questionnaire to all physicians\non the list inquiring about women who had been hospitalized or had\ndied with possible complications related to the use of an IUD in\nthe preceding 6 months. Physicians were asked to check 1 or more of\n8 diagnostic categories for their patients such as complicated\npregnancy, uterine perforation, and hemorrhage. After a second\nmailing of the same questionnaire to physicians who had not\nresponded by August 1, a total of 16,994 responses (49.2%) were\nreceived by January 2, 1974. Subsequently, a 1% probability sample\nwas drawn from the 17,550 non-respondents; field officers were\nsuccessful in obtaining information about IUD complications from\n173 of 176 practices by telephone and personal interviews.\nPhysicians responding by mail provided 3,502 net, unduplicated\ncase reports of women hospitalized in the first 6 months of 1973.\nAfter correction for the non-respondent physicians, approximately\n7,900 IUD-associated hospitalizations were estimated to have\noccurred in this period. Using an estimate by the Family Planning\nEvaluation Division of approximately 3.2 million IUD wearers in\nearly 1973, the calculated rate of IUD-related hospitalizations was\n5 per 1,000 woman-years of IUD use.\nWhile the small number of IUD-related deaths is insufficient\nto demonstrate an increased mortality rate associated with any\nspecific type of device, the overall rate of IUD-related mortality\nappears to be low compared with the mortality rates associated with\npregnancy and other forms of contraception (1). Five fatalities\nwere reported in the 6-month study period by the 16,994 physicians\nwho responded by mail and the documenting details of each of these\ncases supported the suggestion that an IUD had contributed to the\ndeath. Four of the 5 terminal illnesses involved severe infection;\n2 of these 4 infections involved a pregnancy. The devices used by\nthese women were 2 Lippes Loops *, 2 Saf-T-Coils *, and 1 Dalkon\nShield *. These 5 reports imply a minimum IUD-related mortality\nrate\nof approximately 3 per million woman-years of use.\nOf the 3,473 reports which included diagnoses, 2,932 also\nspecified the type of IUD involved. A relative excess of Dalkon\nShield IUDs was observed among case reports carrying the diagnosis\nof ""complicated pregnancy"" (Table_1). The crude odds ratio **\nfor\nall the cases in Table 1 is 2.1 (pless than .001). Separate\nstratifications by the patient\'s age, race, and geographic region\nshow a comparable elevation of the same odds ratio for each group.\nWhen the case reports were stratified by the size of IUD, the odds\nratio for the 180 women with nulliparous-sized IUDs was not\nsignificantly different from 1.0, but was 2.0 and 2.2 for the\nparous (standard) and unknown sizes, respectively, both\nstatistically significant.\nThe 1% sample of non-respondent physicians who were\ninterviewed in person or by phone furnished 60 unduplicated case\nreports. The crude odds ratio for these reports was 8.3 (p=.0049),\nestablishing that a statistical association between the Dalkon\nShield and complicated pregnancies also existed in the experience\nof these physicians.\nSince the use prevalence of the various IUD types in early\n1973 is unknown, it is impossible to draw any firm conclusion about\nthe morbidity rates associated with each device. The magnitude of\nthe odds ratio is influenced not only by the relatively large\nnumber of Dalkon Shields involved in complicated pregnancies\n(numerator of the odds ratio) but also by the relatively small\nnumber of Dalkon Shields involved in complications in non-pregnant\nwomen (denominator of the odds ratio). If the Dalkon Shield\naccounted for more than 41% (Table_1) of the IUDs in use early\nin\n1973, then the observed elevation in the odds ratio might be better\nexplained by a relatively low rate of hospitalizations for\nnon-pregnant complications associated with this type of IUD. Such\na high use prevalence of the Dalkon Shield is very unlikely based\non CDC\'s review of sales data furnished by the major IUD\nmanufacturers. The relative excess of women hospitalized with\ncomplicated pregnancies associated with the standard-sized Dalkon\nShield could possibly be explained by an elevated rate of pregnancy\nwith this device, by an increased rate of complications once a\npregnancy is established, or by a combination of these postulated\nfactors.\nreported by the Committee on Maternal and Child Care of the\nAmerican Medical Association; the American Osteopathic Association;\nand the Family Planning Evaluation Division, Bureau of\nEpidemiology, CDC.\nreference\nTietze C. Mortality with contraception and induced abortion.\nStudies in Family Planning No. 45:6-8, Sept 1969 Editorial Note\nEditorial Note 1997: Since the mid-19th century when Ignaz\nSemmelweiss, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and others showed that\npuerperal fever was both contagious and preventable, epidemiology\nhas been useful as an effective tool to assist in improving\nreproductive health. CDC first applied epidemiology to\nfamily-planning evaluation and reproductive health in the early\n1960s when new female fertility-control measures had become\navailable. Oral contraceptives and plastic intrauterine\ncontraceptive devices (IUDs) provided promising new opportunities\nfor family planning. CDC leaders, especially Alexander D. Langmuir,\nM.D., Chief Epidemiologist, had both enthusiasm and concern about\nthese opportunities. Evidence for the effectiveness of the new\nmethods of contraception was emerging, but potential adverse\neffects remained largely unevaluated. Of specific concern to\nLangmuir was the possible relation between IUD use and pelvic\ninfection. Therefore, in 1964, CDC assigned Nicholas Wright, M.D.,\nan officer in CDC\'s Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) program, to\nGrady Memorial Hospital, a public institution in Atlanta, Georgia,\nwith a large ambulatory-care clinic and approximately 1000 beds, to\ninvestigate the safety of the IUD. Work by Wright and others\ndetermined that women with IUDs had pelvic infections at a higher\nrate than expected but that most of these women could be treated\neffectively and without serious complications.\nA decade later, the MMWR of June 29, 1974, raised questions\nabout the safety of the Dalkon Shield, an IUD marketed during\n1970-1974.\nBoth the AMA and the AOA collaborated with CDC to conduct\nthis survey of physicians in June 1973. Analysis of the case\nreports supplied by the survey respondents showed an excess risk\nfor complicated pregnancies among Dalkon Shield users, compared\nwith users of other IUDs (1). In 1974, the manufacturer withdrew\nthe device from the marketplace.\nIn 1975, CDC reported that Dalkon Shield users were more\nlikely than users of other IUDs to die from spontaneous abortions\n(2). Reports of mid-trimester septic abortions associated with the\nDalkon Shield hastened the passage of the Medical Device Amendments\nof 1976, which gave the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) greater\ncontrol over medical devices. In 1983, CDC reported that Dalkon\nShield users had a greater risk for pelvic inflammatory disease\nthan users of other types of IUDs and non-IUD users (3). In that\nsame year, CDC and FDA recommended that women still using Dalkon\nShield IUDs have them removed. The experience with the Dalkon\nShield has had a dramatic negative impact on the further use of\nIUDs in the United States and has affected the pharmaceutical\nindustry, physicians, and women who otherwise might find the IUD an\nacceptable method of contraception (4,5).\nIUDs, first used in Germany and Japan in the early 1900s,\nshowed great promise after their reintroduction in 1960 as\nbiologically inert plastic devices (6). Thereafter, a large variety\nof devices were produced as manufacturers attempted to identify the\nideal device. The most important recent advance was the development\nof the medicated devices, particularly the copper-bearing IUDs (7).\nThe most commonly used IUD in the United States today -- the Copper\nT380A -- has a low rate of side effects and is perhaps the most\neffective IUD in use internationally, with a pregnancy rate of less\nthan or equal to 1% per year (8). In Europe, the\nlevonorgestrel-releasing device also is associated with few side\neffects, very low failure rates, and reduced menstrual blood flow\nbecause of intra-uterine progestin effect (9). This device has not\nbeen introduced into the United States. As a result, the only\nprogesterone-releasing device available in the United States\nrequires change of the device annually and is rarely used in this\ncountry.\nDuring the 1980s, the noncopper-bearing devices popular in the\n1960s and 1970s were withdrawn from the market for economic reasons\n(4). In 1986, manufacturers also removed copper-bearing devices\nfrom the market -- not because of new information about risks, but\nbecause of the heavy financial burdens imposed on the manufacturers\nby issues related to liability (4).\nThe major safety concern associated with the use of IUDs has\nbeen the risk for developing pelvic inflammatory disease (10).\nRecent studies have suggested, however, that most cases of pelvic\ninfection that occur with an IUD in place are attributable to\nsexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (11,12) and that women at low\nrisk for STDs also are at low risk for pelvic infection while they\nare using an IUD. Further evidence that the IUD is associated with\nlow risk for pelvic infection is documented by a study of\ninfertility in which IUD users with one sexual partner were at no\ngreater risk for infertility than nonusers of the IUD (13). Most\nIUD-attributable infections appear to be related to insertion of\nthe device (12); some of these infections probably are preventable\nwith proper infection-control measures, and trials of the\neffectiveness of administering prophylactic antibiotics at the time\nof insertion are in progress.\nThe 1974 MMWR and subsequent reports by CDC identified an\nincreased risk for infectious morbidity related to use of an IUD\nthat is no longer marketed. Subsequent epidemiologic studies of the\nsafety of currently available devices indicate that women at low\nrisk for STDs are at low risk for pelvic infection with IUD use.\nIn the United States, nearly 60% of pregnancies are unintended\n(14), and many women wanting to prevent unintended pregnancy are\nappropriate candidates for IUD use. Despite evidence that the\nlong-term effectiveness of the Copper T380A device is similar to\nthat of tubal sterilization (15,16), less than 1% of women using\ncontraceptives in 1995 were using this device (17). Among the small\nnumber of women using IUDs, however, acceptance of this method is\nhigh: in 1992, for example, 96% of IUD users viewed their method\nfavorably, compared with 94% of oral contraceptive users, 93% of\nthose who chose male or female sterilization, 76% of diaphragm\nusers, and 74% of rhythm methods users (18). Women desiring\nlong-term effective contraception and their clinicians should be\naware that currently marketed IUDs are highly effective and\nacceptable and are associated with a low risk for complications in\nwomen at low risk for STDs.\nIn addition to highlighting the commemoration of CDC\'s 50th\nanniversary, reprinting this 1974 MMWR coincides with and\nhighlights the 30th anniversary of CDC\'s Division of Reproductive\nHealth. In 1967, the Family Planning Evaluation Activity (FPEA) --\nwhich\nauthored the 1974 report -- was established in CDC\'s Bureau of\nEpidemiology, becoming one of CDC\'s earliest noninfectious disease\nprogram areas. The FPEA began with only four staff members; today,\nthe staff consists of 160 members in what is now the Division of\nReproductive Health, part of CDC\'s National Center for Chronic\nDisease Prevention and Health Promotion. In 1970, the FPEA became\nthe Family Planning Evaluation Division, and the division quickly\nbecame a focus of excellence within CDC, helping to introduce and\ndisseminate further the concepts of analytic epidemiology\neventually adapted by acute/infectious disease programs. From 1967\n(when the division first assigned EIS officers to evaluate\nfamily-planning programs in state health departments) to the\npresent, the links between the division and the EIS have been\ncrucial at CDC in helping to introduce CDC\'s methods of\napplied/field epidemiology to the challenges of reproductive\nhealth, both nationally and internationally. The three decades of\nhistory of the division reflect the creative and effective use of\nepidemiology for the promotion of reproductive health.\n1997 Editorial Note by Allan Rosenfield, MD, DeLamar Professor of\nPublic Health and Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Dean, Columbia\nSchool of Public Health.

See the respective appendix for each method for clarifications to the numeric categories, as well as for summaries of the evidence and additional comments. Hormonal contraceptives and intrauterine devices do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and women using these methods should be counseled that consistent and correct use of the male latex condom reduces the risk for transmission of HIV and other STDs. Use of female condoms can provide protection from transmission of STDs, although data are limited.\nBOX K1. Categories for Classifying Hormonal Contraceptives and IUDs\n1 = A condition for which there is no restriction for the use of the contraceptive method.\n2 = A condition for which the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks.\n3 = A condition for which the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using the method.\n4 = A condition that represents an unacceptable health risk if the contraceptive method is used.\nMenu Select dropdown list\nView AllPersonal Characteristics and Reproductive HistoryCardiovascular DiseaseRheumatic DiseasesNeurologic ConditionsDepressive DisordersReproductive Tract Infections and DisordersHIVOther InfectionsEndocrine ConditionsGastrointestinal ConditionsAnemiasSolid Organ TransplantationDrug Interactions\nTABLE K1.

It\xe2\x80\x99s long-term, reversible, and one of the most effective birth control methods out there.\nX in a circle\nWant an IUD?\nFind a Health Center\nA right arrow in a circle\nZip, City, or State\nWe couldn\'t access your location, please search for a location.\nSearch\nPlease fill out this field.\nSorry, we could not find any Health Center for your search.\nWhat does IUD stand for?\nIUD stands for Intrauterine Device (basically: a device inside your uterus). It\'s a small piece of flexible plastic shaped like a T. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s called an IUC \xe2\x80\x94 intrauterine contraception.\nWhat are the types of IUDs?\nThere are 5\xc2\xa0different brands of IUDs that are FDA approved for use in the United States: Paragard, Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla.\nThese IUDs are divided into 2 types: copper IUDs (Paragard) and hormonal IUDs (Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla).\nThe Paragard IUD doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have hormones. It\xe2\x80\x99s wrapped in a tiny bit of copper, and it protects you from pregnancy for up to 12 years.\nThe Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla IUDs use the hormone progestin to prevent pregnancy. Progestin is very similar to the hormone progesterone that our bodies make naturally. Mirena works for up to 7\xc2\xa0years. Kyleena works for up to 5 years. Liletta works for up to 7\xc2\xa0years. Skyla works\xc2\xa0for up to 3 years.\nHow do IUDs work?\nBoth copper IUDs and hormonal IUDs prevent pregnancy by changing the way sperm cells move\xc2\xa0so they can\'t get to an egg. If sperm can\xe2\x80\x99t make it to an egg, pregnancy can\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\nThe Paragard IUD uses copper to prevent pregnancy. Sperm\xc2\xa0doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like copper, so the Paragard IUD makes it almost impossible for sperm to get to that egg.\nThe hormones in the Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla IUDs prevent pregnancy in two ways: 1) they thicken the mucus that lives on the cervix, which blocks and traps the sperm, and 2) the hormones also sometimes stop eggs from leaving your ovaries (called ovulation), which means there\xe2\x80\x99s no egg for a sperm to fertilize. No egg, no pregnancy.\nOne of the awesome things about IUDs is that they last for years \xe2\x80\x94 but they\xe2\x80\x99re not permanent. If you decide to get pregnant or you just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have your IUD anymore, your nurse or doctor can quickly and easily take it out. You\xe2\x80\x99re able to get pregnant right after the IUD is removed.\nCan IUDs be used as emergency contraception?\nYes! The Paragard (copper) IUD works super well as emergency contraception. If you get it put in within 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected sex, it\xe2\x80\x99s more than 99.9% effective. It\xe2\x80\x99s actually the most effective way to prevent pregnancy after sex.\nAnother great thing about using the copper IUD as emergency contraception: you can keep it and have really effective birth control that you can use for up to 12 years. The other kind of emergency contraception is the morning-after pill. You can take it up to 5 days after unprotected sex to reduce the risk of pregnancy.\nNext\nHow effective are IUDs?\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nHelp us improve - how could this information be more helpful?\nHow did this information help you?\nPlease answer below.\nAre you human?

They usually go away in about 3\xe2\x80\x936 months, once your body gets used to the visitor in your uterus. So if you can stick it out for a few months, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance the side effects will ease up. You can keep track of the side effects you\'re experiencing using our birth control app.\nSide effects can include:\npain when the IUD is put in\ncramping or backaches for a few days after the IUD is put in\nspotting between periods\nirregular periods\nheavier periods and worse menstrual cramps (Paragard)\nPain medicine can usually help with cramping. If the bleeding or cramping gets pretty bad and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get better, tell your nurse or doctor what\'s going on.\nIUDs don\xe2\x80\x99t protect against STDs.\nWhile IUDs are one of the best ways to prevent pregnancy, they don\'t protect you from sexually transmitted infections. Luckily, using condoms every time you have sex reduces the chance of getting or spreading STDs. So the thing to do is to use condoms with your IUD.\nRarely, side effects are serious.\nSerious problems from IUDs are not at all common, but there are some risks and warning signs you should know about.\nMore questions from patients:\nDoes the copper IUD make you gain weight?\nNope! The copper IUD (Paragard) doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cause weight gain.\nBecause the copper IUD is hormone-free, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have many side effects at all. Some people do have heavier, longer periods and more cramping, especially for the first few months.\nRemember \xe2\x80\x94 everyone has a different reaction to each type of birth control, so it\xe2\x80\x99s about finding what works best for you and your lifestyle. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to talk with your doctor or nurse and be patient. It might take a few tries to find your perfect method.

When does the birth control shot take affect? Ive heard that it takes 1 week to even a month to become effective\xe2\x80\xa6\nExactly when the birth control shot starts working depends on when you get it, but it never takes more than seven days to become effective. If you get the birth control shot within the first seven days after the\xc2\xa0start of your period, you\xe2\x80\x99re protected from pregnancy immediately. If you get it at any other point during your cycle, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to use a backup form of birth control, like condoms, for the first seven days.\nEach shot of Depo-Provera will protect you from pregnancy for 12 weeks. So you need to go to your nurse or doctor every 12 weeks for a shot. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t get your shot on time, you could be at risk of getting pregnant. If you\xe2\x80\x99re always on time getting your next shot, you\xe2\x80\x99ll stay protected against pregnancy and won\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about backup birth control at all. That said, since the shot doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offer any protection against STDs, using a condom every time you have sex is still a really good idea because then you\xe2\x80\x99ll be protected against both STDs and pregnancy.\xc2\xa0Read more about the birth control shot.\nTags:\ndepo,\nDepo-Provera,\nbirth control shot,\ndepo shot\nPlanned Parenthood delivers vital reproductive health care, sex education, and information to millions of people worldwide.\nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit under EIN 13-1644147.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a safe, convenient, and private birth control method that works really well if you always get it on time.\nX in a circle\nWant the shot?\nFind a Health Center\nA right arrow in a circle\nZip, City, or State\nWe couldn\'t access your location, please search for a location.\nSearch\nPlease fill out this field.\nSorry, we could not find any Health Center for your search.\nHow does the birth control shot work?\nThe birth control shot (sometimes called Depo-Provera, the Depo shot, or DMPA) contains the hormone progestin. \xc2\xa0Progestin stops you from getting pregnant by preventing ovulation. \xc2\xa0When there\xe2\x80\x99s no egg in the tube, pregnancy can\xe2\x80\x99t happen. It also works by making cervical mucus thicker. When the mucus on the cervix is thicker, the sperm can\xe2\x80\x99t get through. And when the sperm and the egg can\xe2\x80\x99t get together, pregnancy can\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\nDoes the shot protect against STDs?\nNo. The shot is really good at preventing pregnancy, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t protect you from sexually transmitted infections.\nLuckily, using condoms every time you have sex really lowers the chance of getting or spreading STDs. The other great thing about condoms is that they also protect against pregnancy, which means that using condoms along with the shot gives you awesome pregnancy-preventing power!\nHow do I make the shot work best for me?\nTo get the shot\xe2\x80\x99s full birth control powers, you have to remember to get a new shot every 12-13 weeks. That\xe2\x80\x99s about every 3 months, or 4 times a year. Most of the time, a\xc2\xa0doctor or a nurse must give you the shot.\xc2\xa0So you have to make an appointment at a health center, and then remember to go to the appointment. But you also may be able to get a supply of shots at the health center to bring home and give yourself.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You can use our birth control app to keep track of when you need to get your next shot, and any\xc2\xa0upcoming shot appointments.\nYou can start using the birth control shot whenever you want. If you get your first shot within the first 7 days after the start of your period, you\xe2\x80\x99re protected from pregnancy right away. If you get it at any other time in your cycle, you need to use another form of birth control (like a condom) for the first week after getting the shot.\nAfter your first shot, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about remembering when to get your follow-up shots. Here are some tips to make sure you stay on top of it:\nUse our\xc2\xa0birth control reminder app or set an alarm on your phone.\nAdd it to whatever calendar you use on a daily basis.\nAsk friends, family members, or your partner to remind you.\nBottom line: do whatever works for you to make sure you get your follow-up shots about every 12-13 weeks.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re 2 or more weeks late getting your shot, your doctor or nurse may ask you to take a pregnancy test, or tell you to use emergency contraception if you had vaginal sex in the previous 120 hours (five days).\nWant to be extra, super sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t accidentally get pregnant? Also use a condom every time you have vaginal sex. Condoms are the only way to help protect yourself from STDs, so using the shot with condoms is the way to go.\nNext\nHow effective is the shot?\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nHelp us improve - how could this information be more helpful?\nHow did this information help you?\nPlease answer below.\nAre you human?

A majority of those women will use contraception at some point in their lives, yet few large studies include sufficient numbers of overweight and obese participants to allow for accurate conclusions about this population. As a result, questions remain surrounding the outcomes, efficacy and safety of some birth control methods among obese women.\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good deal more research needs to be done on the effects of obesity on a variety of medications and medical devices, including birth control,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planned Parenthood Federation of America Vice President of External Medical Affairs Dr. Vanessa Cullins. \xe2\x80\x9cBut a growing body of new and existing researching is emerging to help providers better advise significantly overweight women in selecting the contraceptive methods that are best for them,\xe2\x80\x9d added Cullins, who helped present and interpret research on birth control use among obese women during a media briefing held today by Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Society of Family Planning. The event covered research that was recently completed by Society of Family Planning fellows and is scheduled to be published later this year. The briefing also provided a summary review and interpretation of previously published research on the topic of obesity and birth control.\nAmong the new findings presented were\n\xc2\xb7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 a study that found the levels of pregnancy-prevention hormones varied significantly between obese and normal weight women using the Implanon implant\n\xc2\xb7\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 research that found young women who gained significant weight after receiving the Depo-Provera contraceptive shot had higher levels of certain fat metabolism enzymes in their fat cells even before they started using the method\nResearch Findings\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen want accurate reproductive health information, and those with weight concerns are no different,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Melissa Gilliam, board president of the Society of Family Planning and professor of obstetrics and gynecology and pediatrics at the University of Chicago. \xe2\x80\x9cThey want to know whether certain contraceptive methods are less effective for them, if there are health risks, and whether some methods are likely to make them gain weight.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn her study, \xe2\x80\x9cPharmacokinetics of Etonogestrel Contraceptive Implant in Obese Women,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Gilliam and colleagues at the University of Chicago studied the pharmacokinetics of the Implanon contraceptive implant in obese women. Implanon is a highly effective, progestin-only hormonal device that is typically implanted in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s arm and can provide protection against pregnancy for up to three years. Clinical trials for the device excluded women who weighed more than 130 percent of ideal body weight, however. Gilliam\xe2\x80\x99s study measured the active ingredient etonogestrel in obese women during various intervals and found that concentration of the hormone were lower for obese women at all time points compared to established rates for normal weight women.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese findings shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be interpreted as showing that Implanon is ineffective at preventing pregnancy in obese women since we did not consider secondary mechanisms by which the implant might prevent pregnancy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gilliam. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is a first step in understanding how this method behaves in significantly overweight women.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn her study, \xe2\x80\x9cBiological Behavior of Adipocytes in Adolescents on Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA): Is It Related to Weight Gain?,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Andrea Bonny, a Society of Family Planning fellow and an assistant professor of pediatrics with the Division of Adolescent Medicine at Nationwide Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital, looked at whether the level of expression of hormone receptors or key fat metabolism enzymes in the fat cells of female teenagers made them more likely to gain weight when using the Depo-Provera (DMPA) contraceptive shot.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile only a minority of teens gain weight as a result of using the Depo-Provera contraceptive shot, researchers have known for a while that some patients, approximately 25 percent, will gain a significant amount of weight while using Depo-Provera. But currently, we have no reliable method of identifying those girls who might gain weight prior to starting Depo-Provera,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bonny. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile our study was small, we were able to show that the young women who gained the most weight had higher levels of expression of certain fat metabolism enzymes in their fat cells even before they started using Depo-Provera. In the future, this discovery could help us identify young women at risk for significant weight gain on depo provera so that they can be counseled appropriately about their contraceptive options.\xc2\xa0 In addition, our findings may help future efforts to prevent weight gain.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDuring her presentation, Dr. Alison Edelman, associate professor with the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Oregon Health & Science University, reviewed two of her previous studies looking at birth control pills and body weight. In \xe2\x80\x9cImpact of Obesity on Oral Contraceptives Pharmacokinetics and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian Activity\xe2\x80\x9d Edelman and her colleagues looked at whether drug levels differed between normal weight and obese women taking low-dose combined oral contraceptives and if this in turn, increased the possibility of ovulation.\xc2\xa0 The study did find differences in drug levels \xe2\x80\x93 especially at the beginning of pill use and after the seven-day hormone-free interval (period week).\xc2\xa0 Theoretically, obese women may be at greater risk for pill failure during these time periods; however, Dr. Edelman noted that large epidemiological studies have found only slight differences in oral contraceptive failure rates between obese and normal-weight women. She cautioned that: \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough some studies do show a slight reduction in contraceptive effectiveness among obese women, these differences are not sufficient enough to overcome the overwhelming benefits achieved by women finding the method that works best them.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn a second study, \xe2\x80\x9cCombined Oral Contraceptives and Body Weight: Do Oral Contraceptives Cause Weight Gain? A Primate Model,\xe2\x80\x9d Edelman wanted to study the impact of birth control on weight in obese versus normal weight subjects.\xc2\xa0 She found that birth control pills where not associated with weight gain in female primates who were given the contraceptive method, and in fact caused a decrease in body weight among obese female primates.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeight changes are difficult to track in humans due to all sorts of external confounding factors.\xc2\xa0 This study helps us see the effect of birth control pills on weight in a controlled environment using a model very similar metabolically and reproductively to women,\xe2\x80\x9d Edelman said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt suggests that obese women could experience a weight-related benefit from oral contraceptives as their method of birth control, and it also adds to the wealth of data showing that oral contraceptives do not cause weight gain.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo hear and see the media briefing link here.

These methods of birth control can prevent unwanted pregnancy up to 20 times better than birth control pills, patches and vaginal rings.\nBirth control is not one-size-fits-all, but a LARC may be right for you. They are a great option for a woman who may want to become pregnant in the future but also desires long-term, highly effective pregnancy prevention. IUDs and implants are reversible\xc2\xa0-\xc2\xa0any time you decide to become pregnant, you can have them removed.\xc2\xa0These methods need to be removed by a health care provider.\nDespite popular misconceptions, IUDs are safe and highly effective for women who have never been pregnant. PPCW staff are trained in IUD insertion, and provide this service on a regular basis to our patients.\nKeep in mind that, like many birth control methods, LARCs don\xe2\x80\x99t protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Be sure to use a condom to reduce your risk of infection.\nBook an Appointment\nZip, City, or State\nWe couldn\'t access your location, please search for a location.\nSearch\nPlease fill out this field.\nSorry, we could not find any Health Center for your search.\nOr call\n1-800-230-7526\nPlanned Parenthood Columbia Willamette\nWho We Are\nPatient Resources\nAbortion and Religious Belief\nOur Health Centers\nPatient Forms\nPaying For Your Visit\nPrEP 101\nPreparing For Your Appointment\nPatient Portal FAQ\nZika Virus Infection (Zika) Facts\nTelehealth\nGet Involved\nEducation & Outreach\nEspa\xc3\xb1ol\nNews\nContact Us\nBook an Appointment\nZip, City, or State\nWe couldn\'t access your location, please search for a location.\nSearch\nPlease fill out this field.\nSorry, we could not find any Health Center for your search.\nOr call\n1-800-230-7526\nPlanned Parenthood is America\xe2\x80\x99s most trusted provider of reproductive health care.\nCall Planned Parenthood\nDonate\nFollow us on\nFollow us on\nFollow us on\nFollow us on\nAbout Us\nToggle Navigation\nWho We Are\nPPAO\nOur Supporters\nToggle Navigation\nGet Involved\nWays to Give\nFinancials\nContact\nToggle Navigation\nStudent Reports and Interviews\nJobs\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nHIPAA\n\xc2\xa9 2020 Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette\n<iframe src=""//www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-MZJZ59""\nheight=""0"" width=""0"" style=""display:none;visibility:hidden""></iframe>'"

Find a Health Center \xe2\x86\x92\nIUD stands for Intrauterine Device \xe2\x80\x94 a birth control method that sits inside your uterus. A hormonal IUD is a small piece of flexible plastic shaped like a T. The hormonal IUD releases a tiny amount of the hormone progestin into your body over several years. Progestin is very similar to the hormone progesterone that our bodies make naturally.\nThe hormones in the IUD help prevent pregnancy, and can also help with painful or heavy periods while you\xe2\x80\x99re using it.\nHormonal IUDs prevent pregnancy by keeping sperm cells away from your eggs. If sperm can\xe2\x80\x99t make it to an egg, pregnancy can\xe2\x80\x99t happen. The hormones in the IUD prevent pregnancy in two ways:\n1) Hormonal IUDs make the mucus on your cervix thicker. This mucus blocks sperm so it can\xe2\x80\x99t get to an egg.\n2) The hormones in the IUD can also stop eggs from leaving your ovaries (called ovulation), which means there\xe2\x80\x99s no egg for a sperm to fertilize. No egg = no pregnancy.\nOne of the awesome things about IUDs is that they last for years, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not permanent. If you decide that you want to get pregnant, or if you just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have your IUD anymore, your nurse or doctor can take it out. After your get your IUD removed, your fertility goes back to normal.\nWhat are the kinds of hormonal IUDs?\nThere are four brands of hormonal IUDs available in the U.S.: Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla. They all work the same and have the same kind of hormone in them. Different hormonal\xc2\xa0IUDs last for different lengths of time: the Mirena and Liletta IUDs\xc2\xa0work\xc2\xa0for up to 7\xc2\xa0years. Kyleena works for up to 5 years.\xc2\xa0Skyla works for up to 3 years.\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have to keep your IUD for that many years though \xe2\x80\x94 you can get your IUD taken out whenever you want. If your IUD is going to expire but you want to keep using an IUD, your nurse or doctor can replace it.\nWhat are the benefits of a hormonal IUD?\nIn addition to preventing pregnancy, many people use hormonal IUDs to help with period problems. Hormonal IUDs can cut down on cramps and make your period way lighter. Some people stop getting their periods at all. Hormonal IUDs can help treat the symptoms of things like endometriosis and PCOS.\nThere are lots of other benefits to IUDs. They\xe2\x80\x99re super convenient \xe2\x80\x94 once your IUD is in place, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to think about birth control for several years. IUDs are also one of the most effective methods of birth control you can get. They\xe2\x80\x99re more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. And if you decide you want to get pregnant, you can get your IUD removed whenever you want and your fertility will go back to normal right away.\nWhat are the disadvantages of a hormonal IUD?\nSome people have side effects after getting a hormonal IUD. They usually go away in about 3\xe2\x80\x936 months, once your body gets used to the visitor in your uterus. So if you can stick it out for a few months, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance the side effects will ease up.\nSide effects can include:\nPain when the IUD is placed, and cramping or back aches for a few days after\nspotting between periods\nirregular periods\nOver-the-counter pain medicine can usually help with cramping. If the bleeding or cramping doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get better, tell your nurse or doctor what\'s going on.\nIUDs are one of the most effective and convenient ways to prevent pregnancy, but they don\'t protect you from sexually transmitted infections. So use condoms with your IUD every time you have sex to lower the chance of getting or spreading STDs.\nPrevious\nHow does IUD removal work?\nNext\nWhat are non-hormonal IUDs?\nBook an Appointment\nZip, City, or State\nWe couldn\'t access your location, please search for a location.\nSearch\nPlease fill out this field.\nSorry, we could not find any Health Center for your search.\nOr call\n1-800-230-7526\nIUD\n99% effective\nCosts up to $1,300, but can be $0\nPut in by a doctor or nurse\nLasts up to 12 years\nThis IUD doesn\xe2\x80\x99t protect you from STDs.

It prevents pregnancy either by damaging or killing a man\xe2\x80\x99s sperm, or blocking it from entering a woman\xe2\x80\x99s uterus. An IUD is a small, T-shaped device with a string attached to the end. The purpose of the string is to make sure the IUD stays in place. It also is how a doctor removes the device.\nThere are 2 types of IUDs available in the United States. ParaGard is the non-hormonal option. It has copper rings, or coils, that alter the chemicals in your uterine fluid to kill sperm. You should not use ParaGard if you are allergic to copper. Hormonal options include Mirena, Liletta, and Skyla. These release progestin hormones to thicken your cervical mucus and stop ovulation.\nPath to improved health\nYour primary care or women\xe2\x80\x99s doctor can insert an IUD. They can insert ParaGard at any time during your menstrual cycle. Hormonal IUDs should be inserted in the first 7 days of your cycle. The procedure is quick and done in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office. The doctor puts a small plastic tube with the IUD into your vagina. You may have pain or cramping during this process. Discomfort can last several hours or days. Most doctors suggest that you have someone else drive you home from the appointment.\nIUDs start working immediately. You can have sex, exercise, and use tampons. An IUD is effective for 3 to 10 years, depending on the type. Your doctor can remove it at any time.\nCall your doctor right away if you have the following symptoms or problems. They will check your IUD, and may remove or replace it.\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t find the string.\nYou can feel the IUD.\nYour IUD comes loose or falls out.\nYou have a fever or chills.\nYou have abnormal blood, fluid, or odor coming from your vagina.\nThings to consider\nYou should not use an IUD if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding. Cancer of the cervix or uterus or AIDS infection prevent IUD use, as well. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use an IUD if you are pregnant or want to become pregnant. You can, however, get an IUD after giving birth. The best time for the doctor to insert it is after delivery of the baby and placenta.\nIUDs do not protect you from sexually transmitted diseases or infections (STDs or STIs). To reduce your risk of getting an STD, use a condom when you have sex. IUDs can affect your menstrual cycle. At first, you may have pain, cramping, or spotting (light bleeding) between periods. This can last for 3 to 6 months. Hormonal IUDs can cause your periods to be irregular. They may also cause you to miss periods. Copper IUDs can cause worse cramps and bleeding during your period.\nThe benefits of IUDs include:\nprevention success rate of 99% when used properly\nuse of 3 to 10 years, depending on the type\ncan be removed by your doctor at any time\nconvenience\nsafe for women who just gave birth and/or are breastfeeding\ncannot be felt during sex\nlow risk of side effects.\nRisks are uncommon, but include:\ninjury to the uterus when the IUD is being inserted\nincreased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease if you have an STD\nchance of getting pregnant, in which case your doctor should remove the IUD. If you become pregnant, the risk of miscarriage and health problems for you and the baby increase.\nchance of an ectopic pregnancy. This occurs when an egg fertilizes outside of your uterus. It is rare, but can be harmful for a woman.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nHow do I know which IUD is right for me, or if I should use another form of birth control?\nAre there any other health conditions that prevent me from using an IUD?\nDoes my age play a factor in which type and brand of IUD I get?\nDoes my insurance cover an IUD?\nHow often do I need to check my IUD, either by a doctor or myself?\nWhat happens after an IUD expires?\nResources\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians, Birth Control Options\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians, Intrauterine Devices\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Intrauterine Devices (IUD)\nLast Updated: May 8, 2017\nThis article was contributed by familydoctor.org editorial staff.\nCategories: Birth Control, Family Health, Prevention and Wellness, Sex and Birth Control, WomenTags: female, gynecologic, Insertion/removal of intrauterine device (IUD) September 1, 2000\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It can help prevent pregnancy if used within 5 days of having sex. You might use emergency contraception if:\nYou had unprotected sex.\nYou had unprotected sex and forgot to take your birth control pills.\nYour partner\xe2\x80\x99s condom broke or slipped off during sex.\nYour diaphragm or sponge came out of place during sex.\nYou were raped.\nThere are 2 types of emergency contraception available. One option is medicine, which is often known as \xe2\x80\x9cthe morning-after pill.\xe2\x80\x9d In the United States, pills that contain levonorgestrel do not require a prescription from your doctor. You can purchase them over the counter at a pharmacy. Pills that contain ulipristal acetate do require a prescription. The second option is to use an IUD that contains copper (ParaGard). You must go to a doctor to have an IUD inserted.\nEmergency contraceptive pills can be very effective if they are used in time. The sooner you take them after sex, the more effective they are. Ulipristal acetate pills reduce your risk of pregnancy more than levonorgestrel pills. They cannot prevent pregnancy if you have unprotected sex after taking them.\nParaGard, an IUD, is a small, T-shaped device that is placed inside your uterus. Unlike pills, IUDs don\xe2\x80\x99t stop your ovaries from releasing an egg. They can prevent an egg from being fertilized or implanted. An IUD is very effective for emergency contraception. It can reduce your risk of pregnancy by more than 99%. This is if your doctor inserts it within 5 days of sex. This IUD can be left in your body for up to 10 years to prevent pregnancy. Some women use IUDs as their regular form of birth control. Common side effects of a ParaGard IUD are heavier, longer periods and spotting or cramping between periods. Symptoms usually improve in the first 3 to 6 months.\nPlaces to get emergency contraception include:\nyour primary care doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office\ncollege/university and women\xe2\x80\x99s health centers\npublic health departments\nhospital emergency departments\nPlanned Parenthood centers.\nPath to improved health\nEmergency contraception can prevent pregnancy by:\nstopping ovulation (the release of an egg from your ovaries)\nstopping sperm from fertilizing an egg\nstopping a fertilized egg from implantation (attaching itself to the wall of your uterus).\nEmergency contraception cannot prevent or end pregnancy if a fertilized egg already is implanted. Because of this, emergency contraception is not a means of abortion.\nMost medicine brands require a single dose of 1 pill. Some brands have 2 doses (1 pill followed by a second pill 12 hours later). Sometimes, you can take both pills together. Follow the instructions for each specific brand. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that some brands of regular birth control pills can be used in increased doses for emergency contraception. However, this method is less effective. It can cause more side effects. Talk to your doctor to see if your birth control pills are safe for emergency use.\nSome women feel nauseous after they take emergency contraceptive pills. This feeling should go away in about 2 days. Your doctor can give you medicine to reduce nausea. Other possible side effects include headache, cramping, and tender breasts.\nThings to consider\nKeep in mind, emergency contraception does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). You should not use any emergency contraception if you know you are pregnant or are trying to get pregnant.\nWomen who are breastfeeding should not use pills that contain ulipristal acetate. Pills also are less effective for women who are overweight or obese. Instead, these women should use the ParaGard IUD. Do not get an IUD if you:\nhave abnormal bleeding\nhave cancer of the cervix or uterus\nhave the AIDS infection\nare allergic to copper.\nEmergency contraceptive pills can affect your menstrual cycle. Talk to your doctor if you do not get your period within 1 month after taking them. Your doctor also can tell you when to start taking your regular form of birth control again. It will vary if you use a hormonal form, such as pills, shots, the patch, or a vaginal ring. If you use a barrier method, such as a diaphragm or condoms, you can start using it right away. If you do not use birth control, talk to your doctor about which method will work best for you.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nWhich type of emergency contraceptive pills should I use?\nWhat happens if I take extra regular birth control pills in an emergency?\nHow soon after unprotected sex should I take a pregnancy test?\nResources\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services: Office on Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health, Emergency Contraception\nLast Updated: May 10, 2017\nThis article was contributed by familydoctor.org editorial staff.\nCategories: Birth Control, Prevention and Wellness, Sex and Birth ControlTags: female, gynecologic, Insertion/removal of intrauterine device (IUD) October 1, 2004\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Overview2. Symptoms3. Diagnosis4. Prevention5. Treatment6. Everyday Life7. Questions8. Resources\nAdvertisement\nWhat is abnormal uterine bleeding?\nAbnormal uterine bleeding is any heavy or unusual bleeding from the uterus (through your vagina). It can occur at any time during your monthly cycle, including during your normal menstrual period.\nSymptoms of abnormal uterine bleeding\nVaginal bleeding between periods is one symptom of abnormal uterine bleeding. Having extremely heavy bleeding during your period can also be considered abnormal uterine bleeding. Very heavy bleeding during a period and/or bleeding that lasts more than 7 days is called menorrhagia. For example, women may bleed enough to soak through 1 or more tampons or sanitary pads every hour.\nBy asking the right questions, I diagnosed a treatable thyroid problem that my patient thought was part of aging.\xc2\xa0 Read\xc2\xa0More\nby Dr. Tania Mathew\nWhat causes abnormal uterine bleeding?\nA variety of things can cause abnormal uterine bleeding. Pregnancy is a common cause. Polyps or fibroids (small and large growths) in the\xc2\xa0uterus\xc2\xa0can also cause bleeding. Rarely, a thyroid problem,\xc2\xa0infection\xc2\xa0of the\xc2\xa0cervix,\xc2\xa0or\xc2\xa0cancer\xc2\xa0of the uterus can cause abnormal uterine bleeding.\nIn most women, abnormal uterine bleeding is caused by a\xc2\xa0hormone\xc2\xa0imbalance. When hormones are the problem, doctors call the problem dysfunctional uterine bleeding, or DUB. Abnormal bleeding caused by hormone imbalance is more common in teenagers or in women who are approaching\xc2\xa0menopause.\nThese are just a few of the problems that can cause abnormal uterine bleeding. These problems can occur at any age, but the likely cause of abnormal uterine bleeding usually depends on your age.\nWomen in their teens, 20s, and 30s\nA common cause of abnormal bleeding in young women and teenagers is pregnancy. Many women have abnormal bleeding in the first few months of a normal pregnancy. Some birth control pills or the intrauterine device (IUD) can also cause abnormal bleeding.\nSome young women who have abnormal uterine bleeding do not release an egg from their ovaries (called ovulation) during their menstrual cycle. This is common for teenagers who have just started getting their periods. This causes a hormone imbalance where the estrogen in your body makes the lining of your uterus (called the endometrium) grow until it gets too thick. When your body gets rid of this lining during your period, the bleeding will be very heavy. A hormone imbalance may also cause your body not to know when to shed the lining. This can cause irregular bleeding (\xe2\x80\x9cspotting\xe2\x80\x9d) between your periods.\nWomen in their 40s and early 50s\nIn the years before\xc2\xa0menopause\xc2\xa0and when menopause begins, women have months when they don\xe2\x80\x99t ovulate. This can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, including heavy periods and lighter, irregular bleeding.\nThickening of the lining of the uterus is another cause of bleeding in women in their 40s and 50s. This thickening can be a warning of uterine\xc2\xa0cancer. If you have abnormal uterine bleeding and you\xe2\x80\x99re in this age group, you need to tell your doctor about it. It may be a normal part of getting older, but it\xe2\x80\x99s important to make sure uterine cancer isn\xe2\x80\x99t the cause.\nWomen after menopause\nHormone replacement therapy is a common cause of uterine bleeding after menopause. Other causes include endometrial and uterine cancer. These cancers are more common in older women than in younger women. But cancer is not always the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. Many other problems can cause bleeding after menopause. For this reason, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to talk to your doctor if you have any bleeding after menopause.\nHow is abnormal uterine bleeding diagnosed?\nThe tests your doctor orders may depend on your age. If you could be pregnant, your doctor may order a pregnancy test. If your bleeding is heavy, in addition to other tests, your doctor may want to check your\xc2\xa0blood\xc2\xa0count to make sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t have\xc2\xa0a low blood count from the blood loss. This could lead to iron deficiency and anemia.\nAn ultrasound exam of your pelvic area shows both the uterus and the ovaries. It may also show the cause of your bleeding.\nYour doctor may want to do an endometrial\xc2\xa0biopsy. This is a test of the uterine lining. It\xe2\x80\x99s done by putting a thin plastic tube (called a\xc2\xa0catheter) into your uterus. Your doctor will use the catheter to remove a tiny piece of the uterine lining. He or she will send that lining to the lab for testing. The test will show if you have cancer or a change in the cells. A biopsy can be done in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office and causes only mild pain.\nAnother test is a hysteroscopy. A thin tube with a tiny camera in it is put into your uterus. The camera lets your doctor see the inside of your uterus. If anything abnormal shows up, your doctor can get a biopsy.\nCan abnormal uterine bleeding be prevented or avoided?\nIf your abnormal uterine bleeding is caused by hormonal changes, you will not be able to prevent it. But if your hormonal changes are caused by being overweight, losing weight could help. Your weight affects your hormone production. Maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent abnormal uterine bleeding.\nAbnormal uterine bleeding treatment\nThere are several treatment options for abnormal bleeding. Your treatment will depend on the cause of your bleeding, your age, and whether you want to get pregnant in the future. Your doctor will help you decide which treatment is right for you. Or, if your doctor decides that a hormone imbalance is causing your abnormal bleeding, you and your doctor may decide to wait and see if the bleeding improves on its own. Some treatment options include the following:\nIntrauterine device (IUD).\xc2\xa0Your doctor may suggest an IUD. An IUD is a small, plastic device that your doctor inserts into your uterus through your\xc2\xa0vagina\xc2\xa0to prevent pregnancy. One type of IUD releases hormones, and this type can significantly reduce abnormal bleeding. Like birth control pills, sometimes IUDs can actually cause abnormal bleeding. Tell your doctor if this happens to you.\nBirth control pills.\xc2\xa0Birth control pills contain hormones that can stop the lining of your uterus from getting too thick. They also can help keep your menstrual cycle regular and reduce cramping. Some types of birth control pills, especially the progestin-only pill (also called the \xe2\x80\x9cmini-pill\xe2\x80\x9d) can actually cause abnormal bleeding for some women. Let your doctor know if the pill you\xe2\x80\x99re taking doesn\xe2\x80\x99t control your abnormal bleeding.\nA D&C, or dilatation and curettage. A D&C is a procedure in which the opening of your cervix is stretched just enough so a surgical tool can be put into your uterus. Your doctor uses this tool to scrape away the lining of your uterus. The removed lining is checked in a lab for abnormal\xc2\xa0tissue. A D&C is done under general\xc2\xa0anesthesia\xc2\xa0(while you\xe2\x80\x99re in a sleep-like state).\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re having heavy bleeding, your doctor may perform a D&C both to find out the problem and to treat the bleeding. The D&C itself often makes heavy bleeding stop. Your doctor will decide if this procedure is necessary.\nHysterectomy.\xc2\xa0This type of surgery removes the uterus. If you have a hysterectomy, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have any more periods and you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get pregnant. Hysterectomy is major surgery that requires general anesthesia and a hospital stay. It may require a long recovery period. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of hysterectomy.\nEndometrial ablation\xc2\xa0is a surgical procedure that destroys the lining of the uterus. Unlike a hysterectomy, it does not remove the uterus. Endometrial ablation may stop all menstrual bleeding in some women. However, some women still have light menstrual bleeding or spotting after endometrial ablation. A few women have regular menstrual periods after the procedure. Women who have endometrial ablation still need to use some form of birth control even though, in most cases, pregnancy is not likely after the procedure.\nYour doctor can do endometrial ablation in several different ways. Newer endometrial ablation techniques do not require general anesthesia or a hospital stay. The recovery time after this procedure is shorter than recovery time after a hysterectomy.\nLiving with abnormal uterine bleeding\nAbnormal uterine bleeding can impact your life in a negative way. Not being able to predict when bleeding will begin can cause you to be anxious all the time. Also, heavy menstrual bleeding may limit your daily activities during your period. For some women, it even prevents them from leaving the house.\nIf you have heavy menstrual bleeding, try taking ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) during your period (or a few days before you expect your period, if you know). Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDs can work to reduce the bleeding during your period.\nYou also should make sure that you are getting enough iron in your diet. Your doctor may prescribe an iron supplement to ensure that you don\xe2\x80\x99t become anemic.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nWhat is the likely cause of my abnormal uterine bleeding?\nIs my condition serious? Am I at risk for any other health problems?\nBased on the cause, what treatment options do you recommend?\nWhat are the risks and benefits of this treatment?\nWill the treatment affect my chances of getting pregnant in the future?\nResources\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Heavy Menstrual Bleeding\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Vaginal Bleeding, Hormonal\nLast Updated: May 18, 2017\nThis article was contributed by: familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCategories: Family Health, WomenTags: Abnormal Bleeding\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It is an injection, or shot, that contains progestin. This is a natural hormone that your ovaries produce each month as part of your menstrual cycle. You must get it from your primary care or women\xe2\x80\x99s doctor. They give you the injection in either your upper arm or buttock. It can go into a muscle (intramuscular) or under your skin (subcutaneous).\nDepo-Provera prevents pregnancy by stopping ovulation (the release of an egg by your ovaries). It thickens your cervical mucus, which makes it hard for sperm to reach and fertilize an egg. It also thins your uterine lining, which makes it hard for a fertilized egg to implant, or attach, to your uterus.\nPath to improved health\nDepo-Provera works for about 3 months at a time. To prevent pregnancy, you have to get 1 shot from your doctor 4 times a year, about 12 to 14 weeks apart. If you get it in the first 7 days of your cycle, it works right away. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to use another form of birth control for 1 week. Your doctor will confirm you are not pregnant before giving you the injection.\nMost women who use Depo-Provera have changes in their menstrual periods. These may include:\nbleeding or spotting between menstrual periods\nan increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding\nno menstrual bleeding at all.\nAbout half of women who use Depo-Provera stop having periods after 1 year. This is not harmful. Menstrual bleeding usually returns to normal when you stop using Depo-Provera. It may take about 9 to 10 months to get pregnant after your last shot.\nContact your doctor right away if you have abnormally heavy or nonstop bleeding. Other possible side effects of Depo-Provera include:\nweight gain\nheadaches\nnervousness\nabdominal pain\ndizziness\nweakness or fatigue\nosteoporosis (loss of bone density)\nblood clots\nchance of an ectopic pregnancy. This occurs when an egg fertilizes outside of your uterus. It is rare, but can be harmful for a woman.\nThings to consider\nDue to an increased risk of osteoporosis, you should limit the use of Depo-Provera to 2 years. Eat foods high in vitamin D and calcium to increase your bone density. Depo-Provera may increase your chance of having breast cancer if you begin using it before the age of 35.\nWomen who are breastfeeding can use Depo-Provera. You should not use it if you are pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or have:\nhigh blood pressure\nheart, kidney, or liver disease\nbreast cancer\na history of heart attack or stroke\nunknown vaginal bleeding\nan allergy to the drug in Depo-Provera.\nDepo-Provera is effective at preventing pregnancy if you get the shots on time. The success rate is more than 99%. It is as effective as having a tubal ligation (getting your \xe2\x80\x9ctubes tied\xe2\x80\x9d). The success rate can be higher than other forms of birth control, including diaphragms, condoms, and pills. Depo-Provera does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). You and/or your partner still should use condoms to prevent getting an STD.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nHow do I know if Depo-Provera is right for me, or if I should use another form of birth control?\nDoes my age play a factor in using Depo-Provera?\nHow long can I take Depo-Provera?\nDoes my insurance cover Depo-Provera?\nResources\nNational Institutes of Health: MedlinePlus, Medroxyprogesterone Injection\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration, Birth Control: Medicines to Help You\nLast Updated: May 10, 2017\nThis article was contributed by familydoctor.org editorial staff.\nCategories: Birth Control, Prevention and Wellness, Sex and Birth ControlTags: female, gynecologic September 1, 2000\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

However, for women of any age trying to prevent a pregnancy, birth control (also called contraception) can help.\nPath to improved health\nThere are many options for preventing a pregnancy. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a method, a medicine, or a device, each has its pros and cons. Some choices are permanent. Others are reversible.\nAbstinence: This means not having sexual intercourse. This is the only foolproof method of preventing a pregnancy.\nBirth control pill: This is a popular form of birth control. Taken every day by mouth, the pill is 99% effective in preventing pregnancy when used as prescribed. There are two types of birth control pills: the combination pill and the mini-pill. The combination pill works by combining the hormones estrogen and progestin to prevent ovulation (which is necessary for a pregnancy to happen). These hormones make your cervical mucus thicker, which makes it harder for sperm to move). They also thin the lining of your uterus, which makes it harder for an egg to attach there. Women who are sensitive to estrogen can take the mini pill. The mini pill only contains the progestin hormone. It prevents pregnancy by thickening cervical mucus and thinning the lining of the uterus.\nOther hormone-based methods:\xc2\xa0These include a patch, shot, implant (under the skin in the arm), and a vaginal ring that releases the hormones. These methods are 91% to 99.95% effective.\nIntrauterine devices (IUDs):\xc2\xa0A doctor inserts this small, T-shaped device into a woman\xe2\x80\x99s uterus. There are two kinds: copper and hormonal (progestins). You may have pain and cramping when inserting and removing IUDs. Copper IUDs might increase menstrual cramping as well. IUDs change the mucus inside a woman\xe2\x80\x99s cervix (the lower end of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s uterus). This prevents the sperm from meeting with the egg. They are more than 99% effective when used properly.\nVaginal barriers:\xc2\xa0Several birth control products can create a barrier between sperm and the uterus. This includes condoms (male and female), diaphragms, cervical caps, and contraceptive sponges. Male condoms are worn by the man. Women can insert a female condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, or contraceptive sponge directly into their vagina on their own. These methods are between 79% to 88% effective.\nSterilization:\xc2\xa0Several surgical procedures can prevent pregnancy. These include female tubal ligation (some people refer to this as having their tubes tied). This procedure surgically blocks a woman\xe2\x80\x99s fallopian tubes. This prevents sperm from entering the fallopian tube. A female hysterectomy (surgically removing the uterus) prevents pregnancy, as well. However, this particular surgery is never performed for birth control.\nFor men, a vasectomy is a form of birth control. This surgical procedure prevents sperm from mixing with a man\xe2\x80\x99s semen when he ejaculates. Neither surgical procedure interferes with sexual intercourse. Both are considered permanent methods of birth control. There are rare instances when the procedures can be reversed. However, it depends on age, circumstances of the first surgery, and potential health complications. Sterilization is more than 99% effective.\nSpermicides: These foam or gel-like substances kill sperm. A woman can apply them directly into the vagina. These are around 72% effective.\nNatural family planning: There is no medicine or device with this form of birth control. It relies on avoiding sexual intercourse in the days leading up to when you are more likely to be ovulating. Ovulation is the time when a woman is most likely to become pregnant. Sperm can live for a short period of time in the vaginal area. So you need to avoid sexual intercourse prior to and during ovulation. Ovulation kits and fertility monitors can help you determine if you are ovulating. Even the visual presence of vaginal discharge (clear or cloudy, stretchy mucus) can mean that you are ovulating. However, natural family planning isn\xe2\x80\x99t an exact science. This method is effective about 76% of the time.\nEmergency contraception: This is not considered a typical method of birth control. It is used in cases where no birth control was used during sexual intercourse. It also is used in cases when a woman knows immediately that birth control has failed (such as when a condom breaks). Emergency contraception comes in the form of a pill (taken up to 5 days after unprotected sex) or with a copper T IUD. This must be inserted by a doctor within 5 days of unprotected sex. It is more than 99% effective.\nThings to consider\nYour choice of birth control should consider several things. This includes your age and overall health. You also should consider the risks and possible non-contraceptive benefits of the method, medicine, or device. Estrogen-containing contraceptives, for example, can increase your risk of blood clots. Some hormonal methods can help with painful periods or heavy menstrual bleeding. Your choice should consider how well it works for your needs. That includes thinking about whether or when you might want to start a family in the future.\nFinally, your choice should consider how frequently you have to manage your birth control. For example, birth control pills must be taken daily. If you are not able to take a pill at the same time each day, you may want to consider another form. Some options (such as hormonal injections and vaginal rings) will last for up to a few months. Spermicides must be applied at least 1 hour prior to having sex. If you are not able to plan ahead or wait, that method would likely not be good for you. Some vaginal rings can be left in for a few months. Barrier methods, such as diaphragms and cervical caps, have to be removed after 6 to 8 hours. Condoms are immediately removed. However, intrauterine devices can stay in place for 3 to 10 years before having to be changed.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nHow do I know which method is best for me?\nDo certain birth control options cause cancer or other chronic diseases?\nAre certain forms better based on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s age?\nOther than a male condom, can any other form of birth control prevent sexually transmitted disease?\nAre certain forms of birth control uncomfortable?\nResources\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, How effective are birth control methods?\nEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contraception and Birth Control: Condition Information\nLast Updated: February 15, 2017\nThis article was contributed by familydoctor.org editorial staff.\nCategories: Birth Control, Prevention and Wellness, Sex and Birth ControlTags: gynecologic, women\'s health January 1, 1999\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It prevents pregnancy by creating a barrier between a woman\xe2\x80\x99s uterus and a man\xe2\x80\x99s sperm. A diaphragm is a reusable dome-shaped cup. It fits over the opening of the cervix. It is common to use a diaphragm with spermicide. This is a gel, cream, or foam that kills sperm.\nThere are 4 types of diaphragms. They are made of either latex or silicone. The most common type is the arching spring diaphragm. It has a firm rim and is easiest to insert. It works best for women who have weak vaginal muscle tone. The coil spring diaphragm has a soft rim that is flexible. It works best for women who have average vaginal muscle tone. The flat spring diaphragm is similar, but has a thin rim. It works best for women who have strong vaginal muscle tone. You can use a diaphragm introducer tool to insert both the coil spring and flat spring types. The wide seal rim diaphragm is a silicone option. It is best for women who are allergic or sensitive to latex. It comes in arching spring or coil spring shapes.\nSee your primary care or women\xe2\x80\x99s doctor to get a diaphragm. They will help you decide which type of diaphragm is best and prescribe it for you. They will do an exam to measure you and find the correct size. If it is too small, it may fall out or not block sperm. If it is too big, it will cause discomfort. The most common size is 75 millimeters (mm). It is important that your diaphragm fits right. Your doctor will show you how to insert it properly and help you practice. It should rest right behind your pubic bone.\nPath to improved health\nOnce your doctor fits you and you\xe2\x80\x99ve practiced inserting your diaphragm, you are ready to use it.\nGet your diaphragm ready\nBefore you insert your diaphragm, you should apply spermicide to it. Put about 1 teaspoon of it in the cup, or dome. Spread it around the rim of the diaphragm. Do not use petroleum jelly or oil-based vaginal creams, such as Monistat. These can make tiny holes in the diaphragm. You also can put some spermicide in your vagina.\nInsert your diaphragm\nYou can insert your diaphragm from several positions. It is best to lie down, squat, or stand with one leg propped up. Your legs need to be open wide. Bending your knees can help. Once you\xe2\x80\x99re in position, follow these steps:\nUse one hand to fold the diaphragm in half with the dome pointing down. Hold your vagina open with your other hand.\nPut the diaphragm into your vagina and aim for your tailbone. Push the diaphragm as far back into your vagina as you can.\nUse one finger to push the front rim of the diaphragm up behind your pubic bone. Aim for your belly button.\nCheck the placement of your diaphragm\nWith your finger, feel for your cervix through the dome of the diaphragm. The cervix will feel firm, but not bony. It feels a bit like the tip of your nose. If you cannot feel your cervix or if it is not covered, then the diaphragm is out of place. You need to remove the diaphragm, apply more spermicide, and insert it again. The diaphragm should not fall out when you cough, squat, sit down, or walk. The diaphragm is in place if it is above your pubic bone.\nUse your diaphragm\nYou must use your diaphragm correctly each time you have sex. With spermicide, this method can prevent pregnancy. You should never use a diaphragm during your menstrual period. You will need to use another form of birth control at this time. Do not douche while you use a diaphragm. Do not leave a diaphragm in your vagina for more than 24 hours. This can cause irritation, infection, or a medicall condition called toxic shock syndrome.\nAfter you have sex\nYou need to apply more spermicide if you have sex more than once. Put some in your vagina, but do not remove your diaphragm. After sex, leave your diaphragm in place for at least 6 hours. To remove your diaphragm, hook your finger on the front rim. Gently pull it down and out. Try not to tear a hole in it with your fingernails.\nTake care of your diaphragm\nWash your diaphragm with mild soap and water after each use. Rinse it off and allow it to air dry. Store the diaphragm in a container that is cool and dry. Check your diaphragm often for holes, tears, or leaks. To do this, fill the dome with water and look for damage. If you find any, do not use the diaphragm again. Get a new one from your doctor. If you keep using it, you increase your risk of getting pregnant.\nThings to consider\nOnce a year, your doctor should check the fit of your diaphragm. It should be replaced about every 2 years. You will need a new one if you have a baby, have pelvic surgery, or gain or lose more than 15 pounds.\nWhen you use a diaphragm and spermicide together, the prevention rate ranges from 70% to 99%. The large range leaves room for misuse. Diaphragms do not protect you from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). They also can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs).\nWhen to see your doctor\nCall your doctor if you have any of the following problems:\nvaginal pain\ntrouble urinating\npainful or frequent urination\nvaginal itching\nabnormal vaginal discharge\nfever. This can be a sign of toxic shock syndrome.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nWhy should I use a diaphragm over another form of birth control?\nAre there any reasons why I can\xe2\x80\x99t use a diaphragm and/or spermicide?\nDoes my insurance cover a diaphragm?\nResources\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians, Diaphragm Fitting\nLast Updated: May 8, 2017\nThis article was contributed by familydoctor.org editorial staff.\nCategories: Birth Control, Family Health, Prevention and Wellness, Sex and Birth Control, WomenTags: Diaphragm fitting, female, gynecologic November 1, 2004\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It is commonly referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cgetting your tubes tied.\xe2\x80\x9d It is a surgery that keeps a woman from getting pregnant. It closes off her fallopian tubes. These tubes carry an egg from the ovary to the uterus each month. Sperm swim up the fallopian tubes to join with the egg, resulting in pregnancy. When the tubes are closed, the egg and sperm cannot reach each other. This prevents pregnancy.\nTubal sterilization is a permanent form of birth control. It is one of the most effective options for preventing pregnancy. But it is difficult to reverse. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t need your partner\xe2\x80\x99s consent to have a tubal sterilization. But talking about the procedure beforehand is best for most relationships.\nPath to improved well being\nTubal sterilization is performed in a hospital or an outpatient surgery center. The procedure can be done on an outpatient basis at any time. Postpartum sterilization can take place right after a woman gives birth, if it was a cesarean delivery (C-section). It can also be performed within hours or days of a vaginal delivery.\nYou will receive anesthesia before the procedure is done. You won\xe2\x80\x99t feel anything. During the procedure, your doctor will likely make 1 or 2 incisions (cuts) in your abdomen. He or she will insert special instruments into the incisions. Using the instruments, they will seal off the fallopian tubes by blocking them with plastic clips, clamps, or rings. Or they may remove or destroy a small piece of each tube.\nAfter the procedure, your doctor will stitch up your incisions. You should be able to go home in a few hours. If the procedure follows childbirth, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to spend any extra time in the hospital.\nAfter the procedure\nYou may have some symptoms after the procedure, including:\nabdominal pain, cramping\nfatigue\ndizziness\ndiscomfort at incision site(s)\nshoulder pain.\nAs with any surgical procedure, problems can sometimes occur. Contact your doctor right away if you:\ndevelop a fever\nbleed from an incision\nhave severe stomach pain that won\xe2\x80\x99t stop\nhave fainting spells.\nRecovery after tubal sterilization is usually complete in a couple of days. You may want to take it easy for a week or so. Avoid heavy lifting for 1 week.\nYou will still have a period after your tubes are tied. Some temporary forms of birth control, such as the pill, help irregular menstrual cycles. Sterilization doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. If you had irregular periods before using any type of birth control, you will likely have irregular periods again after sterilization.\nAsk your doctor how long you should wait after the procedure before having sex. Don\xe2\x80\x99t have sex until you feel comfortable. You usually need to wait about a week after surgery. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wait at least 4 weeks if sterilization is done shortly after childbirth.\nThings to consider\nTubal sterilization is a permanent form of birth control. If you think you might want to reverse the procedure someday, you should not have it done. Reversal is possible, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated, major surgery. It\xe2\x80\x99s not always successful. Even a successful reversal doesn\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee that you can get pregnant again. If you do get pregnant, you have an increased risk of complications, such as ectopic pregnancy. Plus, the surgery is expensive and is usually not covered by health insurance.\nRemember that sterilization won\xe2\x80\x99t protect you against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Always use a condom during sexual activity to prevent STIs.\nSome women worry that sterilization will change them, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. It won\xe2\x80\x99t make you less feminine. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cause weight gain or the growth of facial hair. It won\xe2\x80\x99t decrease your sexual pleasure or cause menopause to start.\nTalk to your doctor anytime you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about a new form of birth control, especially a permanent one. You have many choices. Make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s the best choice for you.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nIs permanent birth control the best choice for me?\nAre there other forms of permanent birth control?\nWhat if I want to reverse the procedure later on?\nWhen is the best time for me to have the procedure done?\nWhat are the risks involved with the procedure?\nCould I get pregnant after having a tubal sterilization?\nResources\nOffice on Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Birth Control Methods\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration, Birth Control: Medicines to Help You\nLast Updated: May 11, 2017\nThis article was contributed by familydoctor.org editorial staff.\nCategories: Birth Control, Prevention and Wellness, Sex and Birth ControlTags: female, gynecologic, tubal ligation June 1, 2004\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Overview2. Symptoms3. Causes4. Diagnosis5. Prevention6. Treatment7. Everyday Life8. Questions9. Resources\nAdvertisement\nWhat is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)?\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an\xc2\xa0infection\xc2\xa0of the female reproductive organs. This includes the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. It is often caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. Other infections that are not STIs can also cause PID.\nLeft untreated, PID can damage a woman\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive organs. It can cause trouble getting pregnant, problems during pregnancy, and long-term pelvic pain.\nSymptoms\nPID causes different symptoms in different women. These may include:\nA dull pain and tenderness in the lower abdomen.\nVaginal discharge that is yellow or green and may have an unpleasant smell.\nIrregular menstrual periods, such as extra-long periods, spotting, or cramps throughout the month.\nChills, fever, nausea,\xc2\xa0diarrhea,\xc2\xa0and vomiting.\nPain during sex.\nLow back pain.\nPainful urination.\nSome women who have PID do not experience these symptoms and do not know they have it.\nIf you have the above symptoms, or if you think you have been exposed to an STI, call your doctor. The sooner you see your doctor, the better. Waiting can allow the infection to spread and cause more pain and damage.\nCauses\nWhat causes PID?\nPID is caused by different types of bacteria. Many times, it is caused by bacteria from STIs. The two most common STIs that cause PID are chlamydia and gonorrhea. Sometimes PID can be caused by normal bacteria found in the vagina. You can get PID if the bacteria move up from your vagina into your reproductive organs.\nThere are several ways women can get PID. The most common way is by having sex with a person who has an STI. These diseases are carried in the\xc2\xa0semen\xc2\xa0and other body fluids of infected people. During sexual contact, the germs spread to the woman\xe2\x80\x99s cervix. The germs can also infect the glands at the opening of the vagina, the urethra (passageway for urine), or the anus.\nSometimes PID can occur after the cervix is treated because of an abnormal Pap smear or after the insertion of an\xc2\xa0intrauterine\xc2\xa0device (IUD). However, this is not common. Rarely, PID can occur as a result of giving birth or having a miscarriage, abortion, or procedure to take a sample from the inside of the womb for laboratory testing.\nWhat are the risk factors for PID?\nThe same things that put you at risk for STIs also put you at risk for PID. Your risk for PID is higher if you:\nHave had an STI\nHave had PID before\nAre a sexually active woman younger than 25 years of age\nHave had multiple sexual partners\nHave unsafe sexual habits\nDouche (this can flush the bacteria up into your genital tract)\nHow is PID diagnosed?\nThere is no single test for PID. Your doctor will diagnose the condition based on your medical history, your symptoms, and a physical exam. He or she may also do some tests. They will do a pelvic exam. This can help them tell if any of your reproductive organs are tender. They may swab the area for a sample and have the sample tested for STIs. They may test for a urinary tract infection or other conditions that can cause pelvic pain. They might also do imaging tests, such as ultrasound. This uses sound waves to create pictures of your organs. It can help your doctor look for signs of PID.\nCan PID be prevented or avoided?\nMany cases of PID can be prevented in the same way that STIs are prevented. The only way to avoid an STI is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex.\nIf you are sexually active, you can lower your risk of getting an STI by:\nUsing condoms. Even though the condom will not prevent 100% of STIs, it will greatly reduce your chances of getting infected. Remember, only a condom can provide some protection against STIs. Other forms of birth control don\xe2\x80\x99t provide this protection.\nGetting tested. Make sure you and your partner are tested for STIs before you have sex. Tell each other the results.\nLimiting sexual partners. Your risk of getting an STI increases with the number of sexual partners you have.\nRemaining monogamous. This means having sex with only one partner.\nNot abusing alcohol or drugs. Drinking too much or using drugs can lead to risky behavior. It can increase your risk of being exposed to STIs.\nNot douching. Douching removes normal bacteria from your vagina that help to fight infections. It also helps bacteria travel up to other areas of the reproductive tract where they can cause infection.\nTreatment\nPID can be treated, especially if it is diagnosed early. It can usually be cured with antibiotics. It is very important that you take all of your medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to, even if your symptoms go away. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t take all the medicine, your symptoms may get worse. A few days after you start taking the medicine, your doctor may want to see you again for a checkup.\nThe sooner your PID is treated, the better. The longer PID is left untreated, the more damage it can cause, and the more likely there will be complications.\nHospitalization may be recommended if you are very sick with PID. It may also be needed if you are pregnant, are under the age of 18, or have HIV.\nShould my partner be treated if I have PID?\nIf you are treated for PID, especially if it\xe2\x80\x99s caused by an STI, your partner must also be treated. Unless your partner is treated, you may be infected again. Making good choices about sexual contact is important. If you think you might have PID, talk to your family doctor right away.\nLiving with PID\nWhat can happen to my body if I get PID?\nEarly and complete treatment can help prevent complications of PID. However, if PID isn\xe2\x80\x99t treated, it can cause permanent damage to your internal organs. Scar\xc2\xa0tissue\xc2\xa0can form in the fallopian tubes and around the abdomen. This tissue can prevent pregnancy. It can also cause the pregnancy to form outside the uterus. This is called a tubal or\xc2\xa0ectopic pregnancy. Scarring can cause pain that lasts for months or even years. Occasionally, the effects of PID can be so severe that surgery is required to remove pus, get rid of scar tissue, or remove damaged organs.\nPID is more likely to come back if you are exposed to STIs again. Each time you have PID, it causes more damage and a greater possibility of complications.\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor\nWhat is the likely cause of my pelvic inflammatory disease?\nDo I need any tests?\nWhat do my test results mean?\nWhat treatment option do you recommend?\nDoes my sexual partner need to be treated too?\nIs it safe for me to have sex now, or do I need to wait until after treatment?\nDo I have scar tissue or other damage to my organs?\nWill I have trouble getting pregnant?\nResources\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health, Pelvic inflammatory disease\nU.S. National Library of Medicine, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease\nLast Updated: August 6, 2018\nThis article was contributed by: familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCategories: WomenTags: cervix, chlamydia, discharge, fallopian, gonorrhea, infection, infertility, inflammatory, oophoritis, organs, pelvic, pelvic peritonitis, reproductive, sexually, sickness, sputum-ovarian abscess, system, vaginal\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It\'s sometimes referred to as a nonhormonal IUD option.\nThe ParaGard device is a T-shaped plastic frame that\'s inserted into the uterus. Copper wire coiled around the device produces an inflammatory reaction that is toxic to sperm and eggs (ova), preventing pregnancy.\nParaGard is the only copper IUD available in the United States. It can prevent pregnancy for up to 10 years after insertion.\nWhy it\'s doneParaGard offers effective, long-term contraception. It can be used in premenopausal women of all ages, including teenagers.\nAmong various benefits, ParaGard:\nEliminates the need to interrupt sex for contraception\nCan remain in place for up to 10 years\nCan be removed at any time\nCan be used while breast-feeding\nDoesn\'t carry the risk of side effects, such as blood clots, related to hormonal birth control methods\nCan be used for emergency contraception if inserted within five days after unprotected sex\nParaGard isn\'t appropriate for everyone. Your health care provider may discourage use of ParaGard if you:\nHave uterine abnormalities \xe2\x80\x94 such as large fibroids \xe2\x80\x94 that interfere with the placement or retention of ParaGard\nHave a pelvic infection, such as pelvic inflammatory disease\nHave uterine or cervical cancer\nHave unexplained vaginal bleeding\nAre allergic to any component of ParaGard\nHave a disorder that causes too much copper to accumulate in your liver, brain and other vital organs (Wilson\'s disease)\nRisksLess than 1 percent of women who use ParaGard will get pregnant in the first year of typical use. Over time, risk of pregnancy in women who use ParaGard remains low.\nIf you do conceive while using ParaGard, you\'re at high risk of an ectopic pregnancy \xe2\x80\x94 when the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. But because ParaGard prevents most pregnancies, the overall risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is lower than it is for sexually active women who don\'t use contraception.\nParaGard doesn\'t offer protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nSide effects associated with ParaGard include:\nBleeding between periods\nCramps\nSevere menstrual pain and heavy bleeding\nIt\'s also possible to expel ParaGard from your uterus. You might not feel the expulsion if it occurs.\nYou may be more likely to expel ParaGard if you:\nHave never been pregnant\nHave heavy or prolonged periods\nHave severe menstrual pain\nPreviously expelled an IUD\nAre younger than age 25\nHad the IUD inserted immediately after childbirth\nHow you prepareParaGard can be inserted anytime during a normal menstrual cycle. If you just had a baby, your doctor might recommend waiting about eight weeks after delivery before inserting ParaGard.\nBefore inserting ParaGard, your health care provider will evaluate your overall health and do a pelvic exam. You may have a pregnancy test to confirm you\'re not pregnant, and you may be screened for STIs.\nTaking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), one to two hours before the procedure can help reduce cramping.\nWhat you can expect\nParaGard placement\nOpen pop-up dialog box\nClose\nParaGard placement\nParaGard placement\nThe ParaGard IUD can remain in place in your uterus for up to 10 years. Short strings connected to the device extend beyond the cervix into the vagina and allow for device removal.\nParaGard is typically inserted in a health care provider\'s office.\nDuring the procedureYour health care provider will insert a speculum into your vagina and clean your vagina and cervix with an antiseptic solution. A special instrument might be used to gently align your cervical canal and uterine cavity. Next, your health care provider will fold down ParaGard\'s horizontal arms and place the device inside an applicator tube.\nThe tube is inserted into your cervical canal and ParaGard is carefully placed in your uterus. When the applicator tube is removed, ParaGard will remain in place. Your health care provider will trim ParaGard\'s strings so that they don\'t protrude too far into the vagina and may record the length of the strings.\nDuring ParaGard insertion, you may experience dizziness, fainting, nausea, low blood pressure or a slower than normal heart rate. Your health care provider will likely suggest that you stay lying down for a few minutes to allow these side effects to pass. Rarely, it\'s possible for the IUD to perforate the uterine wall or cervix. If this complication occurs, your health care provider will discuss the appropriate management.\nAfter the procedureAbout a month after ParaGard is inserted, your health care provider may re-examine you to make sure the device hasn\'t moved and to check for signs and symptoms of infection.\nWhile you\'re using ParaGard, contact your health care provider immediately if you have:\nSigns or symptoms of pregnancy\nUnusually heavy vaginal bleeding\nFoul vaginal discharge\nWorsening pelvic pain\nSevere abdominal pain or tenderness\nUnexplained fever\nPossible exposure to an STI\nIt\'s also important to contact your health care provider immediately if you think your ParaGard is no longer in place. Call your doctor if:\nYou have breakthrough bleeding or bleeding after sex\nSex is painful for you or your partner\nThe strings are missing or suddenly seem longer\nYou feel part of the device at your cervix or in your vagina\nYour health care provider will check the location of ParaGard and remove it if necessary.\nRemovalParaGard is usually removed in a health care provider\'s office. Your provider will likely use forceps to grasp the device\'s strings and gently pull. The device\'s arms will fold upward as it\'s withdrawn from the uterus.\nLight bleeding and cramping are common during removal. Rarely, removal can be more complicated.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nRequest an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\nFeb. 11, 2020\nPrint\nShare on: FacebookTwitter\nShow references\nHatcher RA, et al., eds.

To prevent pregnancy, Mirena:\nThickens mucus in the cervix to stop sperm from reaching or fertilizing an egg\nThins the lining of the uterus and partially suppresses ovulation\nMirena prevents pregnancy for up to five years after insertion. It\'s one of several hormonal IUDs with Food and Drug Administration approval.\nWhy it\'s doneMirena offers effective, long-term contraception. It can be used in premenopausal women of all ages, including teenagers.\nAmong various benefits, Mirena:\nEliminates the need to interrupt sex for contraception\nDoesn\'t require partner participation\nCan remain in place for up to five years\nCan be removed at any time, followed by a quick return to your normal fertility\nCan be used while breast-feeding \xe2\x80\x94 although your health care provider will likely recommend waiting six to eight weeks after childbirth because earlier placement increases the risk of injuring the uterus during placement\nDoesn\'t carry the risk of side effects related to birth control methods containing estrogen\nMirena can decrease menstrual bleeding after three or more months of use. About 20 percent of women stop having periods after one year of using Mirena.\nMirena can also decrease:\nSevere menstrual pain and pain related to the abnormal growth of uterine-lining tissue outside the uterus (endometriosis)\nThe risk of pelvic infection\nThe risk of endometrial cancer\nBecause of these noncontraceptive benefits, Mirena is often prescribed for women with:\nHeavy menstrual bleeding\nCramping or pain with periods\nEndometriosis\nAbnormal growth of the lining of the uterus (endometrial hyperplasia)\nAbnormal growth of uterine-lining tissue into the muscular wall of the uterus (adenomyosis)\nAnemia\nFibroids\nMirena isn\'t appropriate for everyone. Your health care provider may discourage use of Mirena if you have:\nBreast cancer, or have had it\nUterine or cervical cancer\nLiver disease\nUterine abnormalities, such as fibroids, that interfere with the placement or retention of Mirena\nA pelvic infection or current pelvic inflammatory disease\nUnexplained vaginal bleeding\nTell your health care provider if you:\nTake any medications, including nonprescription and herbal products\nHave diabetes or high blood pressure\nHave a heart condition or have had a heart attack\nHave migraines\nHave blood-clotting problems or have had a stroke\nRecently gave birth or are breast-feeding\nRisksLess than 1 percent of women who use Mirena will get pregnant in a year of typical use.\nIf you do conceive while using Mirena, you\'re at higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy \xe2\x80\x94 when the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. However, because Mirena prevents most pregnancies, women who use it are at lower risk of having an ectopic pregnancy than are other sexually active women who are not using contraception.\nMirena is generally safe. But it\'s important to remember that:\nMirena doesn\'t protect against STIs.\nRarely, insertion of Mirena causes perforation of the uterus. The risk of perforation might be higher when inserted during the postpartum period.\nSide effects associated with Mirena include:\nHeadache\nAcne\nBreast tenderness\nIrregular bleeding, which can improve after six months of use\nMood changes\nCramping or pelvic pain\nIt\'s also possible to expel Mirena from your uterus. You may be more likely to expel Mirena if you:\nHave never been pregnant\nHave heavy or prolonged periods\nHave severe menstrual pain\nPreviously expelled an IUD\nAre younger than age 20\nHad Mirena inserted immediately after childbirth\nYour health care provider may recommend removal of Mirena if you develop:\nA pelvic infection\nInflammation of the endometrium (endometritis)\nEndometrial or cervical cancer\nPelvic pain or pain during sex\nVery severe migraine\nA significant increase in blood pressure, or have a stroke or heart attack\nPossible exposure to an STI\nHow you prepareYour health care provider will evaluate your overall health and do a pelvic exam before inserting Mirena. You may be screened for STIs.\nMirena can be inserted:\nAnytime during your menstrual cycle if you\'re not pregnant. You might need to take a pregnancy test to confirm you\'re not pregnant.\nImmediately after a pregnancy termination.\nImmediately after delivering a baby vaginally or by cesarean section \xe2\x80\x94 although insertion immediately after vaginal delivery increases the risk of expelling Mirena.\nIf you have Mirena inserted more than seven days after the start of your period, be sure to use backup contraception for one week.\nTaking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), one to two hours before the procedure can help reduce cramping.\nWhat you can expect\nMirena placement\nOpen pop-up dialog box\nClose\nMirena placement\nMirena placement\nThe Mirena intrauterine device (IUD) is inserted into the uterus by a health care provider using a special applicator.

Be careful not to pull on the strings.\nAbout a month after Mirena is inserted, your health care provider may re-examine you to make sure Mirena hasn\'t moved and to check for signs and symptoms of infection.\nWhile you\'re using Mirena, contact your health care provider immediately if you:\nThink you may be pregnant\nHave unusually heavy, persistent vaginal bleeding\nHave abdominal pain or pain during sex\nHave an unexplained fever\nHave unusual or foul-smelling vaginal discharge, lesions or sores\nDevelop very severe headaches or migraines\nHave yellowing of the skin or eyes\nWere exposed to an STI\nCan no longer feel the IUD strings, or they suddenly seem longer\nIt\'s also important to contact your health care provider immediately if you think Mirena is no longer in place.

To remove Mirena, your health care provider will likely use forceps to grasp the device\'s strings and gently pull. The device\'s arms will fold upward as it\'s withdrawn from the uterus.\nLight bleeding and cramping is common during removal.

This is a rare and life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.\nAn IUD can increase your risk of having a serious infection of the female organs, called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or endometritis (pregnancy-related), which can be serious, even life threatening. This infection could cause scarring of the female organs, which may make it hard for you to become pregnant in the future, and can increase your risk of ectopic pregnancy.\nCall your doctor right away if you have flu-like symptoms, fever, chills, cramps, pain, bleeding, or fluid leaking from your vagina. These may be signs that you have an infection.\nThis medicine may also increase your risk of having ovarian cysts or breast cancer. Talk to your doctor if this concerns you.\nThis medicine may also increase your risk of having high blood pressure (hypertension), clotting problems, or serious heart and blood vessel problems such as a heart attack or stroke. Check with your doctor right away if you start having dizziness, fainting spells, severe tiredness, chest pain, trouble with breathing, sudden or severe headache, problems with vision, speech, or walking, or unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness.\nThis device will not protect you from getting HIV/AIDS, herpes, or other sexually transmitted diseases. Tell your doctor if you or your partner begins to have sexual intercourse with other people, or you or your partner tests positive for a sexually transmitted disease. If this is a concern for you, talk with your doctor.\nIt is important to tell your doctor that you are using this medicine before you have a medical procedure, such as magnetic resonance imaging or MRI.\nDo not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal (eg, St. John\'s wort) or vitamin supplements.\nSide Effects\nAlong with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.\nCheck with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur:\nMore common\nAbsent, missed, or irregular menstrual periods\nlonger or heavier menstrual periods\nmild bloating\nstomach or pelvic pain\nstopping of menstrual bleeding\nunusually heavy or unexpected menstrual bleeding\nuterine bleeding between menstrual periods\nvaginal bleeding or spotting\nLess common\nBlurred vision\ncramps\ndizziness\nheadache\nheavy bleeding\nitching of the vagina or genital area\nnervousness\npain\npain during sexual intercourse\npale skin\npounding in the ears\nslow or fast heartbeat\nswelling\nthick, white vaginal discharge with mild or no odor\ntroubled breathing with exertion\nunusual bleeding or bruising\nunusual tiredness or weakness\nwhite or brownish vaginal discharge\nRare\nChills\nconfusion\ndizziness, lightheadedness, fainting\nfast heartbeat\nfast, weak pulse\nfever\npale, cold, clammy skin\nrapid, shallow breathing\nsudden increase in stomach or shoulder pain\nsweating\nunusual or large amount of vaginal bleeding\nIncidence not known\nClear or bloody discharge from the nipple\ndimpling of the breast skin\ndull or aching stomach pain\nfoul-smelling vaginal discharge\nincreased blood pressure\nincreased urge to urinate\ninverted nipple\nlarge, hive-like swelling on the face, eyelids, lips, tongue, throat, hands, legs, feet, or sex organs\nlump in the breast or under the arm\npain during urination\npersistent crusting or scaling of the nipple\nredness or swelling of the breast\nsevere stomach pain or cramping\nsharp pain on insertion\nshivering fever\nsores on the skin of the breast that does not heal\nSome side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention.

Know the options and how to pick the type of contraception that\'s right for you.By Mayo Clinic Staff\nIf you\'re considering using birth control (contraception), you have a variety of options. To help pick the right method of birth control for you and your partner, consider the following questions.\nWhat birth control options are available?\nYour birth control options include:\nBarrier methods. Examples include male and female condoms, as well as the diaphragm, cervical cap and contraceptive sponge.\nShort-acting hormonal methods. Examples include birth control pills, as well as the vaginal ring (NuvaRing), skin patch (Xulane) and contraceptive injection (Depo-Provera). These are considered short-acting methods because you have to remember to use them on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.\nLong-acting hormonal methods. Examples include the copper IUD (ParaGard), the hormonal IUD (Mirena, Skyla, Kyleena, others) and the contraceptive implant (Nexplanon). These are considered long-acting methods because they last for three to 10 years after insertion \xe2\x80\x94 depending on the device \xe2\x80\x94 or until you decide to have the device removed.\nSterilization. This is a permanent method of birth control. Examples include tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men.\nFertility awareness methods. These methods focus on knowing which days of the month you are able to get pregnant (fertile), often based on basal body temperature and cervical mucus. To avoid getting pregnant, you do not have sex on or around the days you are fertile, or you use a barrier method of birth control.\nIt\'s also important to be aware of emergency contraception \xe2\x80\x94 such as the morning-after pill (Plan B One-Step, Aftera, ella, others) \xe2\x80\x94 which can be used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex.\nHow do the different birth control options work?\nVarious types of birth control work in different ways. Birth control methods may:\nPrevent sperm from reaching the egg\nInactivate or damage sperm\nPrevent an egg from being released each month\nAlter the lining of the uterus so that a fertilized egg doesn\'t attach to it\nThicken cervical mucus so that sperm can\'t easily pass through it\nWhat is the method\'s effectiveness?\nTo be effective, any method of contraception must be used consistently and correctly. Contraceptives that require little effort on your part, such as IUDs, contraceptive implants and sterilization, are associated with lower pregnancy rates. In contrast, methods that require monitoring fertility or periodic abstinence are associated with higher pregnancy rates.\nIs it reversible?\nThe method of contraception you choose depends on your reproductive goals. If you\'re planning pregnancy in the near future, you may want a method that\'s easily stopped or quickly reversible, such as a short-acting hormonal method or a barrier method. If you want to prevent pregnancy for a longer amount of time, you may consider a long-acting method, such as an IUD. If you\'re certain that you don\'t want to get pregnant at any time in the future, you may prefer a permanent method, such as sterilization. You may find that different contraceptive options work for you at different stages of your life.\nIs it compatible with your religious beliefs or cultural practices?\nSome forms of birth control are considered a violation of certain religious laws or cultural traditions. Weigh the risks and benefits of a birth control method against your personal convictions.\nIs it convenient and affordable?\nIt\'s important to choose a type of birth control that suits your lifestyle. For some people, the most convenient form of birth control may be one that is easy to use, has no bothersome side effects or does not disrupt the sexual experience. For others, convenience means no prescription is required. When choosing a method of birth control, consider how willing you are to plan ahead or follow a rigid medication schedule.\nSome methods of contraception are inexpensive, while others are more costly. Ask your insurance provider about your coverage, and then consider the expense as you make a decision.\nWhat are the side effects?\nConsider your tolerance for the possible side effects associated with a particular birth control method. Some methods pose more side effects \xe2\x80\x94 some potentially serious \xe2\x80\x94 than others. Talk to your doctor about your medical history and how it might affect your choice of birth control.\nDoes it protect against sexually transmitted infections?\nMale and female condoms are the only methods of birth control that offer reliable protection from sexually transmitted infections. Unless you are in a mutually monogamous relationship and have been tested for sexually transmitted infections, use a new condom every time you have sex in addition to any other method of birth control you use.\nDoes it offer other benefits?\nIn addition to preventing pregnancy, some contraceptives provide benefits such as more predictable, lighter menstrual cycles, a decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections or a reduction in the risk of some cancers. If these benefits are important to you, they may influence your choice of birth control option.\nIs it acceptable to your sexual partner?\nYour partner may have birth control preferences that are similar to or different from your own. Discuss birth control options with your partner to help determine which method is acceptable to both of you.\nWhat\'s the bottom line?\nThe best method of birth control for you is one that is safe, that you are comfortable using, and that you are able to use consistently and correctly. Your preferred method of birth control may change over your lifetime and is influenced by many different factors, including:\nYour age and health history\nYour reproductive goals, such as the number of children you want and how soon you want to get pregnant\nRelationship factors, including marital status, number of sexual partners, how often you have sex and partner preferences\nReligious beliefs\nDifferences between birth control methods, including how effective they are at preventing pregnancy, side effects, cost and whether they prevent sexually transmitted infections\nKnowing your options is definitely part of the decision process \xe2\x80\x94 but an honest assessment of yourself and your relationships is just as important when deciding which type of birth control is right for you.\nShareTweet\nFeb. 06, 2020\nShow references\nContraception.

These visits will usually be 4 to 6 weeks after insertion and then once a year, but some doctors would require them more often.\nCall your doctor right away if you think you have become pregnant while you are using this medicine. You may have a higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy (occurs outside the womb) if you get pregnant while your IUD is in place. This can be a serious and life-threatening condition. It can also cause problems that may make it harder for you to become pregnant in the future.\nAn IUD can slip partly or all the way out of your uterus without you knowing it. If this happens, you will have no protection against getting pregnant or you may have an increased risk for serious problems. This is more likely during the first year that you have your IUD, but it can happen at any time. Regularly checking the string of your IUD can tell you if it is still in place.\nYou may have some blood spotting and cramping during the first few weeks after the IUD has been inserted. These symptoms should go away within a few months. Rarely, the IUD may make a hole in the wall of your uterus when it is inserted. If this happens, check with your doctor right away.\nUsing Kyleena\xe2\x84\xa2, Liletta\xc2\xae, Mirena\xc2\xae, or Skyla\xc2\xae can increase your risk for severe infections, including sepsis. This is a rare and life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.\nAn IUD can increase your risk of having a serious infection of the female organs, called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or endometritis (pregnancy-related), which can be serious, even life threatening. This infection could cause scarring of the female organs, which may make it hard for you to become pregnant in the future, and can increase your risk of ectopic pregnancy.\nCall your doctor right away if you have flu-like symptoms, fever, chills, cramps, pain, bleeding, or fluid leaking from your vagina. These may be signs that you have an infection.\nThis medicine may also increase your risk of having ovarian cysts or breast cancer. Talk to your doctor if this concerns you.\nThis medicine may also increase your risk of having high blood pressure (hypertension), clotting problems, or serious heart and blood vessel problems such as a heart attack or stroke. Check with your doctor right away if you start having dizziness, fainting spells, severe tiredness, chest pain, trouble with breathing, sudden or severe headache, problems with vision, speech, or walking, or unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness.\nThis device will not protect you from getting HIV/AIDS, herpes, or other sexually transmitted diseases. Tell your doctor if you or your partner begins to have sexual intercourse with other people, or you or your partner tests positive for a sexually transmitted disease. If this is a concern for you, talk with your doctor.\nIt is important to tell your doctor that you are using this medicine before you have a medical procedure, such as magnetic resonance imaging or MRI.\nDo not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal (eg, St. John's wort) or vitamin supplements.\nProper UseSide Effects\nPortions of this document last updated:\nMarch 01, 2020\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2020 IBM Watson Health.

The implant releases a low, steady dose of a progestational hormone to thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus (endometrium). The implant typically suppresses ovulation as well.\nContraceptive implants are a long-term birth control option for women. A contraceptive implant is a flexible plastic rod about the size of a matchstick that is placed under the skin of the upper arm.\nIt releases a low, steady dose of a progestational hormone to thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus (endometrium). Contraceptive implants typically suppress ovulation as well.\nOne version of contraceptive implant \xe2\x80\x94 Implanon \xe2\x80\x94 was discontinued by its manufacturer in 2014 and replaced with a newer version called Nexplanon. Nexplanon is radio opaque, which means it can be seen on X-ray, which is useful for checking the location of the implant.\nWhy it\'s doneContraceptive implants offer effective, long-term contraception. Among various benefits, a contraceptive implant:\nCan be removed at any time, followed by a quick return to fertility\nEliminates the need to interrupt sex for contraception\nContains no estrogen\nContraceptive implants aren\'t appropriate for everyone, however. Your health care provider may discourage use of a contraceptive implant if you:\nAre allergic to any components of the implant\nHave had serious blood clots, a heart attack or a stroke\nHave liver tumors or liver disease\nHave known or suspected breast cancer or a history of breast cancer\nHave undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding\nAlthough the label for etonogestrel (Nexplanon) says it shouldn\'t be used by women with a history of blood clots, it isn\'t clear whether the contraceptive implant affects the risk of blood clots. The warning comes from studies of combination birth control pills that contain the same progestin as is used in the contraceptive implant.\nTalk to your health care provider if you have any risk factors for blood clots, including a history of blood clots in your legs or a prior diagnosis of a blood clot in your lungs (pulmonary embolus).\nIn addition, tell your health care provider if you have a history of:\nAn allergic reaction to anesthetics or antiseptics\nDepression\nDiabetes\nGallbladder disease\nHigh blood pressure\nHigh cholesterol or high triglycerides\nSeizures or epilepsy\nThe contraceptive implant isn\'t contraindicated for use in women who are overweight. However, it\'s possible the device may not be as effective in women with a body mass index (BMI) above 30.\nCertain medications and herbal products may decrease the levels of progestin in your blood, which can decrease the contraceptive implant\'s effectiveness. Medications known to interact with the contraceptive implant include some seizure medications, certain sedatives, some HIV medications, as well as the herb St. John\'s wort. Talk with your doctor about your contraceptive options if you take any of these medications.\nRequest an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\nRisksThe contraceptive implant doesn\'t offer protection from sexually transmitted infections.\nFewer than 1 out of 100 women who use the contraceptive implant for one year will get pregnant. If you do conceive while using a contraceptive implant, there\'s a higher chance that the pregnancy will be ectopic \xe2\x80\x94 when the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. However, because a contraceptive implant prevents most pregnancies, women who use it are at lower risk of having an ectopic pregnancy than are other sexually active women who aren\'t using contraception.\nSide effects associated with contraceptive implants include:\nAbdominal or back pain\nAn increased risk of noncancerous ovarian cysts\nChanges in vaginal bleeding patterns, including absence of menstruation (amenorrhea)\nDecreased sex drive\nDizziness\nHeadaches\nMild insulin resistance\nMood swings and depression\nNausea or upset stomach\nPotential interaction with other medications\nSore breasts\nVaginal inflammation or dryness\nWeight gain\nHow you prepareYour health care provider will evaluate your overall health before inserting the contraceptive implant. He or she will determine the appropriate timing for the insertion of the implant based on your menstrual cycle and your previous birth control method. You may need to take a pregnancy test and use a nonhormonal backup method of contraception for one week.\nA backup method of contraception may not be necessary if you previously:\nUsed no contraception and have the contraceptive implant inserted during the first five days of your menstrual cycle, even if you\'re still bleeding\nUsed combination birth control pills, a vaginal ring or a patch for birth control and have the contraceptive implant inserted within seven days of the start of your hormone-free period\nUsed the minipill and have the contraceptive implant inserted while taking active pills\nUsed a contraceptive injection and have the contraceptive implant inserted the day your next injection is due\nUsed another contraceptive implant or an intrauterine device (IUD) and have the etonogestrel implant (Nexplanon) inserted the day your previous device is removed\nWhat you can expect\nInsertion of contraceptive implant\nOpen pop-up dialog box\nClose\nInsertion of contraceptive implant\nInsertion of contraceptive implant\nThe contraceptive implant is inserted beneath the skin of the upper arm. The implant releases a progestational hormone to prevent sperm from reaching the egg. The implant typically suppresses ovulation as well.\nYou can have a contraceptive implant inserted during a visit to your health care provider\'s office. The actual procedure takes just a minute or so, though preparation will take a bit longer.\nDuring the procedure\nYou\'ll lie on your back with the arm that will receive the implant bent at the elbow and positioned near your head. Your health care provider will locate a groove between the biceps and triceps muscles on the inner side of your upper arm. He or she will inject a local anesthetic and then use an applicator to insert the device just beneath your skin. Inserting the device too deeply makes removal difficult.\nAfter the procedure\nYour health care provider will feel your arm to confirm the presence of the implant and have you do the same. If necessary, he or she may also use an ultrasound or X-ray to confirm that the device has been inserted.\nYour health care provider will cover the insertion site with a small bandage. He or she may also apply a pressure bandage to minimize bruising. You can remove the pressure bandage in 24 hours, but keep the small bandage clean and in place for three to five days.\nIt\'s common to experience some degree of bruising, pain, scarring or bleeding at the insertion site.\nContact your health care provider if you develop:\nBreast lumps\nHeavy, prolonged vaginal bleeding\nSigns or symptoms of a blood clot in your leg, such as persistent pain and swelling in your calf\nSigns or symptoms of jaundice, such as yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes\nSigns or symptoms of an infection at the insertion site, such as tenderness, redness, swelling or discharge\nSigns or symptoms of pregnancy at any time after the contraceptive implant is inserted\nRemoval\nThe contraceptive implant can prevent pregnancy for up to three years. It must be removed and replaced at the three-year point to continue offering protection from unintended pregnancy.\nYour health care provider may recommend removing the contraceptive implant earlier if you develop:\nMigraine with aura\nHeart disease or stroke\nUncontrolled high blood pressure\nJaundice\nSignificant depression\nTo remove the device, your health care provider will inject a local anesthetic in your arm beneath the implant. He or she will make a small incision in your skin and will push the implant toward the incision until the tip is visible and can be grasped with forceps.\nYour health care provider will then pull out the implant, close the incision and apply a pressure bandage. Contraceptive implant removal typically takes less than five minutes.\nIf you choose, a new device can be implanted as soon as the original device is removed. Be prepared to use another type of contraception right away if you don\'t have a new device inserted.\nResultsA contraceptive implant can prevent pregnancy for up to three years. It must be removed and replaced every three years to continue prevent pregnancy.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nRequest an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\nDoctors & Departments\nAug. 15, 2019\nPrint\nShare on: FacebookTwitter\nShow references\nHatcher RA, et al.
