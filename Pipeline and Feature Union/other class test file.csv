Make an Appointment  Call 334-244-3281   Information regarding Tuberculosis  TB is primarily an airborne disease. The bacteria are spread from person to person in tiny microscopic droplets when a TB sufferer coughs, sneezes, speaks, sings, or laughs. Only people with active TB can spread the disease to others. One would have to have been in close proximity (dorm room, classroom, etc.) to an individual with active TB in order to become infected.  When an active case is identified, it is mandatory that the Alabama Public Health Department (APHD) take over the investigation, surveillance and management of the case. That has occurred in this case. An appropriate team from the APHD has been established that will identify potential exposures and implement the appropriate measures. If any AUM students have been exposed, they should be caught in the “surveillance net.”  This information is for information purposes ONLY.  You may contact AUM Student Health Services at 244-3281 for additional information                Related Links     AUM Counseling Services    Student Health Insurance                  Student health Center Staff       Carol Stewart  Senior Director  334-244-3281  cstewar3@aum.edu       Melodye Harvey  Nurse Practitioner  334-244-3417  Mharvey2@aum.edu        Amy Morris  Registered Nurse  334-244-3281  amorris2@aum.edu                   Back to Top         Colleges   College of Business  College of Education  College of Liberal Arts & Social Sciences  College of Nursing & Health Sciences  College of Sciences     University Links   Administration  AUM Bookstore  Blackboard  Careers at AUM  Center for Disability Services  Conference Services  Consumer Information  Continuing Education and Community Engagement  Financial Aid  Gender Matters and Title IX  Human Resources  IT Services  Institutional Effectiveness  Library  More Information  MyAUM  Office of Sponsored Programs  Office of University Communications  Office of University Marketing  Online Learning  Pressroom  SACSCOC Accreditation  Transcripts/Registrar  WebPay  Website Feedback         P.O.

Student Health Services Immunization and Medical Records Verification for New Students For the safety of our campus community, all students are required to have certain up-to-date immunizations before arriving on campus. As such, all new students must verify their immunization and medical histories through our Student Medical Report and Immunization form.  All incoming students, regardless of classification, must have the following vaccinations:  Meningitis Vaccine (A, C, Y, W-135) – within the past five (5) years  Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccine – All students born after 1956 must have had 2 doses of the vaccine. One dose must have been a Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. A copy of a lab report showing proof of immunity from measles (rubeola), mumps, and rubella can be submitted in lieu of the vaccine.  TB Screening – Within 12 months prior to enrollment term  I mmunization Form – Must be downloaded then submitted electronically via admitme@uwa.edu or via fax at 205-652-3881  If the TB skin test is positive, please submit either results of a T-Spot blood test or chest X-Ray report from a physician stating no signs of tuberculosis. Students who are found to have a positive test will not be permitted to attend classes until follow-up testing can be completed and it is determined there is no active Tuberculosis disease.  *Online Learners are not required to provide proof of immunizations.  Failure to comply with Immunization and Medical records verification , including verification of all required immunizations and TB screening/testing, will result in an inability to register for classes and participate in other pre-fall activities such as athletics, band, cheerleader tryouts or practice, or residence hall check-in.  Individual Colleges, e.g. Division of Nursing, may have additional immunization requirements. These are general guidelines to be interpreted by the staff and subject to change based on the medical needs of the University.  Medical history information and immunization/TB records MUST be submitted at least one month prior to your intended enrollment date: We recommend having everything verified prior to your attendance at UWA Orientation, as you will not be allowed to register for classes without being cleared.  Immunization and Medical Records Form Instructions  You MUST follow these instructions to submit the required medical history and immunization form. This form MUST be included in your medical history submission. Documentation without the required immunization form will not be accepted.  Click here to download & print your Student Medical Report and Immunization Form.  Complete all medical history information.  Have your medical provider complete your immunization certificate.  Scan the complete and signed form and any other documents (clear and readable photographs are acceptable)  Email or fax an image of your form to admitme@uwa.edu or 205-652-3881.

About Appointments Eligibility Other Our Mission The Student Health Center is here to support you in reaching your goals while at the University of Alaska Southeast, and beyond. The Health Center exists because the Chancellor, faculty, and staff recognize the critically important role that vitality and health play in gaining lifelong happiness and success. UAS Health Center Clinician Amanda Arra, physician assistant (PA-C), is the clinician for the UAS Health Center. Amanda has worked as a PA-C since 2002 and has lived in Juneau for 25 years. She is also a health educator and enjoys working with students in achieving optimal health. Confidentiality Your personal health information is considered protected health information by federal law. The UAS Health Clinic is committed to maintaining the privacy of your health information. During your first visit, you will receive our Notice of Use of Private Health Care Information which describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed and what your rights are regarding your protected health information. Please talk with one of our staff if you have questions. The Student Health Center is a Safe Zone Safe Zones at UAS are places where students can feel welcome. The purpose of Safe Zone is to reduce homophobia and heterosexism on the UAS campus, making our campus a safer and freer environment for all members of our community regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Appointments Call 796-6000 to make an appointment. You do not need to say why you need an appointment, but if you need a physical exam or have more than one concern, please ask for an hour long appointment. When you check in for each appointment, you must show your UAS ID. Students may have up to 6 appointments at the Health Center each semester. Call in advance to cancel if you cannot make your appointment! Cancellation Any student who ""no shows"" for three (3) appointments in one semester will lose eligibility for that semester. In order to avoid a “no-show” on your record, simply call in advance of your appointment to cancel – even if it’s just a few minutes in advance. A voicemail is acceptable when date and time is included. There is a 10 minute grace period for all appointments. Eligibility Students taking at least one Juneau campus credit are eligible to use Health Center services. UAS recognizes students taking classes from around the state, but living in Juneau, as campus partners. Students enrolled in at least six credits from any UA institution may opt to pay a $60 fee per semester to use the Health Center. Eligible students should visit the UAS Student Accounts office first to arrange payment. Staff and faculty are not eligible to use the Health Center. Cancellation Any student who ""no shows"" for three (3) appointments in one semester will lose eligibility for that semester. In order to avoid a “no-show” on your record, simply call in advance of your appointment to cancel – even if it’s just a few minutes in advance. A voicemail is acceptable when date and time is included. There is a 10 minute grace period for all appointments. Tuberculosis (PPD) Testing Students living on campus or working in certain fields are required to have an annual Tuberculosis test. The UAS Health Clinic will provide one free test per student per year. Each Tuberculosis test requires two appointments – a placement appointment and a follow up appointment. Students who miss the second appointment will be charged for a retest. Test cost: $15.00 Chronic Pain Management The UAS Health Clinic does not provide chronic pain management for students. Chronic pain management is defined as needing a controlled substance, such as a narcotic, to control persistent, ongoing pain. Chronic pain management needs must be met through an outside clinic or doctor. UAS is not responsible for assisting the student with finding a clinic or doctor to manage chronic pain needs. Controlled Substances Students receiving prescriptions for controlled substances through the UAS Health Clinic agree to abide by policies set forth under the University of Alaska Board of Regent’s Student Code of Conduct Category: Misuse of Alcohol or Other Intoxicant or Drugs. Students who violate this Code of Conduct may forfeit their right to UAS Health Clinic Services.

There are currently no cases in Arkansas. According to its website, the Arkansas Department of Health, 100 recent travelers are being monitored with daily ADH check-in and guidance. Contracting the virus is dependent on exposure, which means for most UAPB stakeholders the risk for contracting the COVID-19 virus is low. However, COVID-19, like the flu, is something we should take seriously.  Dr. Laurence B. Alexander, Chancellor, convened a Coronavirus Response Team to coordinate activities that support the health and well-being of university stakeholders. The team has developed a contingency plan for university operations should the virus cause a temporary closure. UAMS is also offering innovative 24/7 online access to UAMS health providers through UAMS HealthNow . With this service, people of all ages across the state can receive treatment for flu-like symptoms from their smartphone, computer or tablet without leaving home.  We ask that you please take precautions to avoid spreading respiratory illnesses like COVID-19. To that end, we ask that you review the Travel Guidance for UAPB Employees .

Flu  Action Steps to Save Lives  Information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus  Meningococcal Meningitis Advisement  *Meningococcal Meningitis is a rare but potentially dangerous illness.  Although the risk of contracting this disease is low for the general population, there is a greater potential risk of outbreaks for college-aged students due to a prevalence of risk factors that are often part of campus life.  These risk factors include residence hall living, active and passive smoking, bar patronage, and alcohol consumption.  As a preventative measure, Student Health Services recommends students check with their health care providers for further information about available vaccines or contact us at (870) 460-1051.  *-as required by Arkansas Legislative Act 1233  Tuberculosis Screening  Arkansas Law indicates that any student who was *foreign born* is subject to the requirements of the Arkansas Department of Health Tuberculosis Screening Program for Foreign Born University and College Students.   In order to comply with these regulations, the student must begin by completing and printing a  Tuberculin Skin Testing Database Questionnaire .  Take the completed form to UAM Student Health Services located in the Randy S.

Physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and clinical assistants provide basic outpatient services for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and subacute illnesses and injuries. For medical and surgical problems which are beyond the scope of the Student Health Services, students are provided with referrals to local community health facilities. General Information Eligibility All students currently enrolled at CSUDH are eligible for services upon proof of enrollment. First Aid and referrals are available to all faculty, staff, and visitors at no cost. Appointments Appointments may be made in person at the Student Health Center (SHC) or by telephone at (310) 243-3629. A limited number of same-day appointments may be available. If you cannot keep your appointment, please call to cancel as soon as possible. Students can sometimes be seen on a walk-in basis, but a wait may be required. Your First Visit Please visit our Forms page to find the forms that you'll need to complete and bring with you to your first visit. Confidentiality Your SHC medical record is confidential. Information will not be released to anyone without your written consent, including parents, spouse, friends, and/or university personnel, except in those few circumstances where the law requires disclosure of confidential information. Also, cases of communicable diseases must be reported to the Department of Public Health. Please click  here  to see our full policy on Privacy and Confidentiality of Medical Information. Urgent Care Students with acute minor illnesses or injuries which require urgent medical attention may be seen at the Health Center without an appointment. The walk-in policy is first come, first served, except when your condition takes precedence. The walk-in patient will be assessed by the triage nurse and a determination will be made as to whether the patient will be worked into the existing schedule or given an appointment to return at a later time. If you have more than one medical complaint, the provider may elect to deal with the most urgent and ask you to schedule an appointment to allow more time for handling your other medical needs. Preventive Care The Student Health Center recognizes that preventable medical problems account for a majority of illnesses throughout the United States. Healthy choices can be promoted and reinforced. We offer ""routine"" physical exams, immunizations, medical consultations, and a variety of screening tests to identify preventable diseases and conditions. Immunizations CSUDH requires certain  immunizations to attend the university . Though meningitis vaccination is not required, it is strongly recommended by the CDC for all students living in CSUDH Housing. Please be advised that there are now two separate meningitis vaccines (one covers strains A, C, Y, and W; another covers strain B), since 50% of meningitis disease is currently caused by strain B and 50% by strains A, C, Y, W combined. Additionally, it is advised that students be current on their TdaP immunization (vaccinated within the past 10 years). Men's Health Care This service is established to care for male-related problems. We provide exams, consultations, and referrals for specific conditions. Our focus is to educate men concerning such issues related to sexually transmitted diseases (STD's), contraception, and testicular and prostate cancer. Women's Health Care We provide a broad range of women's health services. They include annual gynecological exams, pap smears, birth control, pregnancy testing, screening and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, and other gynecological problems. ""Annual"" exams are available by appointment. Support Services Pharmacy Services Our pharmacy is licensed by the State Board of Pharmacy and is operated by a registered pharmacist. Prescriptions written by both SHS and outside physicians can be filled, often at a much lower price than that charged by outside pharmacies. Over-the-counter medications are also available at reduced prices. Laboratory Services Our nationally accredited laboratory is equipped to perform basic laboratory work (i.e. blood count, urinalysis, etc.). Complex laboratory services are sent out to a reference lab for a nominal fee. Health Education Health Education promotes health and wellness through education and outreach programs on various topics. Presentations for clubs, organizations, and classes are available upon request. If you have any questions, please JoAnn Aragon-Valdivia, our Health Educator, at jaragon@csudh.edu . Radiology Services A radiological technologist provides basic diagnostic x-rays at no cost when requested by a medical provider. All x-rays are reviewed by a Board Certified Radiologist. If you need a copy of your x-ray, there is a $5.00 service charge per film. Medical Records/Reception The medical records and reception staff supports a variety of areas, including appointments, walk-ins, medical records management, phone requests, and general coordination of SHS functions. We wish to extend our warmest welcome to all students utilizing our services. After Hours Care There are no After Hours Care or On-Call services at CSUDH Student Health Services. Students who require after hours care should seek their private physician/health plan or a local emergency room/urgent care center. Student Health Fees Students at CSUDH pay a mandatory student health fee each semester which covers the cost of most of our services. These fees provide you health care services that would otherwise cost considerably more. Take a look at the chart below for a comparison between CSUDH Student Health Center Fees and the standard cost you'd pay at a local urgent care center. Comparison Chart  Our Student Health Center Cost  vs Standard Urgent Care Center Cost   Student Health Fee - $75.00   Student Health Fee - $0  Office visit per semester - $0   Office Fee, initial - $125  CBC (Blood count) - $0   CBC (Blood count) - $15  Chest X-ray - $0   Chest X-ray - $75  Urinalysis - $0   Urinalysis - $15  TB Test - $0   TB Test - $20  Throat Culture - $0   Throat Culture - $25  Decongestant - $2   Decongestant - $10  Antibiotic - $4   Antibiotic - $15  Total (Including SHC Fee) - $81.00   Total (No SHC Fee) - $300.00 Note: There is a fee for some services, such as pharmacy, outside laboratory tests, and selected immunizations. These fees must be paid in full prior to receiving services. The SHS staff should explain all extra fees to your satisfaction. Supplemental Health Insurance Health insurance is recommended for all students, but is not required to use the Student Health Services. A supplemental plan written specifically for CSUDH students is available through Associated Students, Inc (ASI). For more information, contact the ASI Office or visit the CSU Healthlink website below: Health Insurance Information Associated Students, Inc.

A Message on Student Fees The CSU makes every effort to keep student costs to a minimum. Fees listed in published schedules or student accounts may need to be increased when public funding is inadequate. Therefore, CSU must reserve the right, even after fees are initially charged or initial fee payments are made, to increase or modify any listed fees. All listed fees, other than mandatory systemwide fees, are subject to change without notice, until the date when instruction for a particular semester or quarter has begun. All CSU listed fees should be regarded as estimates that are subject to change upon approval by the Board of Trustees, the Chancellor, or the Presidents, as appropriate. Changes in mandatory systemwide fees will be made in accordance with the requirements of the Working Families Student Fee Transparency and Accountability Act  (Sections 66028 - 66028.6 of the Education Code) .

For more information: Center for Disease control  Resources for Faculty and Staff  Promoting-Student-Mental-Health_Faculty-Staff Handbook  PSMH_Riverside             YOU’RE COVERED BY SHIP!  As a student, you are automatically enrolled in UCR’s  Student Health Insurance Program (SHIP) and exempt from purchasing a plan on the Covered CA website or your home state exchange. SHIP meets the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), gives you nationwide coverage, and offers the big advantage of convenient, on-campus care. Find out more about SHIP .      Why SHIP is a Good Plan   SHIP provides nationwide coverage. Exchange plans or private insurance plans may not provide national coverage.  SHIP offers the most convenience. Students can see a doctor and nurse on campus with no out-of-pocket expense. X-rays, lab work and even prescriptions are available. With other health insurance plans, students pay out-of-pocket or will have to go off campus for covered care.  SHIP provides vision and dental coverage at no extra cost. With many other health plans, vision and dental coverage is EXTRA.  SHIP meets all the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.  A student can be covered by SHIP even if the family is participating in Covered CA or a home state exchange plan.      You Can Rejoin SHIP   If you waived out of SHIP, but now realize it is the best plan for your needs, you can rejoin! Simply call the Student Health Services (SHS) Insurance office at (951) 827-5683 to sign up again.     Before You Submit a Waiver   If you have insurance and wish to be exempt from the UC SHIP Plan, your insurance plan must meet the following criteria:  Must provide primary care within 50 miles of campus (or your address while attending UCR)  Cannot limit the amount it will pay for any injury or illness you have during your lifetime  Cannot have a pharmacy deductible greater than $250 per year  Cannot require you to pay out-of pocket more than $6,350 per year  Cannot have a clause that excludes a pre-existing condition  International Plans  No reimbursement plans accepted  Must have claims office in the United States      How to Submit a Waiver   If your plan meets the criteria and you would like to waive SHIP, submit an online waiver form by the appropriate deadline. You only need to submit one per year. There is a $50 fee for late forms. Forms will not be accepted after the first day of instruction.

Unlike a traditional ""school nurse"" office, Student Health Services is a fully-functioning healthcare office much like your primary care physician. Therefore, we see scheduled patients, emergencies, and walk-ins. It is recommended that you make an appointment, but if you need to be seen, we will do our best to accommodate you quickly. This means there may be a slight wait for you to be seen, as we prioritize our patient load in the following way: emergencies, scheduled patients, walk-ins. Please see us for all of your healthcare needs.       Do I need an appointment to be seen in your office?  No, an appointment is not required to be seen, but highly recommended due to the volume of students we see on a daily basis. If you need to be seen, there may be a short wait as we prioritize emergencies and scheduled patients first. We will do our best to accommodate your healthcare needs quickly and effectively.       Does the University offer health insurance for students?  Unfortunately, the University no longer offers health insurance for students. Due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), we have a list of websites that you can access to sign up for affordable healthcare. Please see on our insurance information page .           Campus Safety: Coronavirus (COVID-19)  We have a number of individuals working on a plan to ensure that we are prepared to take care of our students and employees in the event our campus is directly impacted by the coronavirus.

The Health Service strives to promote health awareness for our students and academic community through educational programs, counseling, and promoting healthy behaviors that facilitate academic success.  For many students, college life is a very exciting, yet stressful time. You will face exams, assignment deadlines, and the task of balancing both work and a social life. To do that, you will need maximum energy, self confidence and a healthy outlook on life. Therefore, regular exercise, information about  the foods you eat, and an awareness of any changes in your body, are essential to maintaining your good health. The staff at the University Health Service are committed to helping you achieve these goals.  Location:  Litchfield Hall.  Our entrance is on White Street across from the parking garage.  Hours:  Monday through Friday  8 am – 4 pm (closed 12 pm-1 pm)  For after hours emergencies call 911 or Campus Police ( 203  837-9300)  Health Service Staff:  Nancy Haensch, MS, APRN, NP-C, Director  Joanne Zanella, RN  Dawn Lipke, Administrative Assistant  Contact Information:  Phone: 203 837-8594  FAX: 203 837-8583  Services Provided:  All full time students are eligible for care at Health Service when classes are in session.

Costs:  There are charges for some medications, supplies, and services provided by Health Service.  These will be added to your student account and are your responsibility.  Services or charges incurred outside of Health Service, such as x-rays and laboratory tests, referrals to physicians, emergency room care, ambulance and hospitalization will be billed to the insurance you have provided.

Services are free for students registered for six or more credits.  Student health and counseling services are provided in the:  Florence J. Hunt Student Health and Wellness Center  Hours:  Monday-Friday, 8:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m.  Fort Valley State University  1005 State University Drive  Fort Valley, GA 31030  Phone: (478) 822-1035  The Hunt Student Health Center is located across from Troup Hall and next to the Home Management House. The center is staffed by physicians, staff nurses, and nurse assistants.  Everyone Has Issues     You may visit the center on your own because you have a physical  or mental health issue you would like to explore with a professional. You might also come to us after talking to someone who cares about you, such as a friend or maybe a faculty member who wants you to address any challenges keeping you from performing at your best level and encourages you to get help (a performance referral).  Thoughts to Consider   Serious issues usually do not go away on their own. While gaining an education and training that leads to a career, a person could also make progress on personal issues.  Problems are easier to fix at their beginning, before they get too complicated. Dealing with something sooner rather than later is better.  A friend who helps you face a problem and get help is often a better friend than one who helps you avoid it.   Areas of Service:   Basic Health and Wellness Services  Date Violence Issues  Issues Associated with Children of Addicted/Alcoholic Parents  Grief and Loss Counseling  Alcohol and Other Drugs Issues  Quitting Smoking  Anger Management  HIV-AIDS Services  Social Skills  Stress Management  Test Anxiety Issues  Conflict Resolution                 Meet the Director  Jacqueline L. Caskey-James is a highly engaged health professional committed to helping students achieve success.  Learn more...

University Health Service (UHS) offers services for full-time undergraduate UK students and students who have paid the Health Fee .  The board-certified physicians, nurse practitioners, counselors and professional staff at UHS provide high-quality care. Also, a registered nurse is available for phone consultation about illness, injuries, lab results or other health concerns, and there is an on-call physician available for telephone consultation for urgent situations when UHS is closed.  Our services include primary care, gynecology/genitourinary (GYN/GU), nursing and behavioral health and health education services for nutrition, tobacco cessation and sexual health.  Students must make an appointment to be treated at UHS. We do not take walk-ins, so please call or schedule an appointment online in advance. Students can usually be seen the same day or the next day.  While the Health Fee does not include dental care, the UK College of Dentistry has a no-cost dental care service for undergraduate students. Learn more about available services here . Additional dental service options are available on campus both in the Kentucky Clinic and the Dental Science Building.  See our guidelines for verification of absence from class .  Questions?

Student Health and Wellbeing Services (SHWS) are a team of dedicated professionals that want to help you succeed in your personal and academic paths at Humboldt State University by supporting your general health and wellbeing.  SHWS consists of Medical Services , Counseling and Psychological Services , and Health Education . Student Medical Services and Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at HSU are fully-accredited, including a medical clinic with lab, pharmacy, x-ray services, and a team of mental health professionals. Our licensed medical professionals include physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, medical assistants, clinical laboratory scientists and a radiological technologist.  Our professional mental health providers include licensed psychologists and marriage and family therapists, as well as therapists fulfilling professional training at our site (e.g., postgraduate residents and practicum trainees).  Our front office staff is welcoming, knowledgeable and always happy to assist you with health records, appointment scheduling and any other questions.  Please get to know our team of professionals in our medical and counseling units.   In our Recreation & Wellness facility, our Health Education team and the Peer Health Educators focus on health-promoting fun activities for students.  Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), located in Student Health and Counseling (SHC) Building, as well as at BSS 208, offers confidential services for short-term mental health issues. Together, our Student Health and Wellbeing Services team is dedicated to helping you overcome health barriers to academic success. Statement Regarding the Current Political Climate: Intersecting oppressive forces such as racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, among others have long been present in American society, however we are seeing a troubling focus currently on these issues by people in the most powerful positions in our country. This rhetoric can have an adverse effect on all people, however we specifically recognize that members of our campus community from traditionally marginalized and/or oppressed identities may be experiencing unique and specific concerns related to our national and local political landscape. It is necessary for our office to state our commitment to social and environmental justice and to creating a world without systemic injustice and violence. We are dedicated to creating an environment where those who have experienced marginalization can feel validated, seen and heard, and belong. The Staff of Health & Wellbeing Services -- including our medical staff, counseling and psychological services team (CAPS), and professional and peer health educators are all dedicated to providing support to all students, regardless of race, ethnicity, size, gender expression, ability, religion, or nationality. We encourage our community to engage in active reflection to identify the ways in which you may (even unconsciously) be contributing to the marginalization of others and to engage in active anti-oppression action that will challenge and change our community. In order to better serve ALL our students we have built a FAQ for DACA students and undocumented students who might have questions about how to access our resources. It can be found here. Our Health and Wellbeing Staff! Finding us SHC is located just up the hill from the HSU Library off Plaza Circle, and hours of operation can be found on the Medical and CAPS websites.  Please note that CAPS also has a second location, operational starting in October, at BSS 208. Should you require medical assistance outside these hours, there is free access to an after-hours nursing advice hotline (877) 256-3534.  Should you require psychological assistance outside of open hours, you can call the CAPS main line at (707) 826-3236 to speak with a counselor by phone.  See our websites for contact information and maps to other medical facilities and psychological resources in our community. Accessing our services The SHC is mainly funded by the required Health Services fee, paid as part of the tuition, and billed directly to student accounts. SHC services are provided to regularly enrolled and IELE students.  For a small fee, CAPS will also provide couples therapy for the non-student partner of a student when the two are in therapy together. Though most of our medical services at SHC are free, there are some services and supplies that may require a small fee.  A few examples of these are immunizations, TB skin tests, prescription and over-the-counter medicines, x-rays, laboratory work, and splints / braces. The medical services fee schedule is available here. HSU is located in Humboldt County, a rural, medically-underserved area. Primary Care Providers (our providers may not be designated as PCPs – this role must be filled by the physician designated by your insurance plan), as well as some medical specialists, are in short supply. It is very important that you and your family research available medical options, including psychiatry, before coming to HSU so you may be sure your needs are met. It is also important to note that, because of our high volume of patient visits, we cannot provide care for long-term issues, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic health (including psychiatric) problems or treatment for Adult Attention Deficit Disorder, nor can we qualify students for permanent disability. Our Health and Wellbeing Services team have a lot to offer. Please familiarize yourself with our websites and call if you have questions. We look forward to working with you!

About University Health Services  The purpose of university Health Services (UHS) at the University of the District of Columbia is to ensure a healthy campus environment and to promote the individual health and wellness of all members of the university community. UHS is committed to providing caring, quality, confidential services to the university community, inclusive of all sexual orientations and gender identities. It is our goal to provide affirming health and wellness services. We provide mandatory and routine preventative health care, urgent health care, and specialist referrals. Preventative health services include lectures, workshops, disease screenings, immunizations, routine gynecological exams and routine physical exams. UHS is staffed by board certified licensed nurse practitioners, medical office assistants, program coordinators and a student health services coordinator.  All students, regardless of age, with chronic medical conditions (e.g., allergies, seizures, diabetes, high blood pressure) are recommended to have a medical history on file with UHS that documents any pertinent information and medical examinations related to any physical/mental disability and or significant medical conditions which could impact their academic performance or medical care in an emergency.  By DC Immunization Law and university policy, it is mandatory for all students enrolled for classes at the university and Community College to be immunized prior to starting classes. Students must show proof of immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, and varicella (chicken pox), and meningitis. Students under the age of 18 must also show proof for polio immunization. Once you receive your letter of acceptance from the university, you should obtain your immunization records from your previous school, primary care provide, military or local health department then present it to UHS (not the Office of Admissions) on or before the day you come to register for classes. Health professions students preparing for clinical rotations are required to show proof of immunization and free of other specific communicable diseases.  All records must be written in English. If you are missing any of the above vaccines, please plan to obtain the vaccines from your private health care providers’ office or neighborhood health clinic. You may also visit University Health Services at the Van Ness Main campus to obtain vaccinations for a fee considerably less than other clinics and health retailers. Students covered by the student health insurance plan are eligible for all vaccines at no cost.  Students in the healthcare professions and athletics programs are required to submit proof of a recent physical examination and documentation of required laboratory testing per program’s specific requirements.

Mission Statement  GSW's Health Services aim to advance the health of students by providing a spectrum of cost effective services. Our Health Services are committed to integrating primary prevention clinical health services, through referral, mental health services and various forms of healthcare counseling. We will strive to become the principle advocate for a healthy campus community.  Clinic  The Health Clinic is staffed by licensed Nurse Practitioners, we are located adjacent to Carter 1 The Rosalynn Carter Health and Human Science/ Nursing Building. A valid GSW student ID card is required for services. Services are available to currently registered GSW students beginning on the first day of class through the last day of finals each semester.  Parents  The health clinic understands that you may worry about your students health and well being, and we encourage you to have an open relationship with you student when it comes to their health care. However, as health care providers, we must follow HIPPA and Patient's Right guidelines. This means the health clinic is unable to discuss any information regarding your son or daughter, if they are 18 years or older. We ask that you refer to the HIPPA and Privacy Guidelines tabs at the top of this page for any clarification on this matter.  FLU Vaccines  The Health clinic strongly suggest everyone get vaccinated against the flu. We will advertise when we have the flu vaccine available.

That's because there is no single thing that make students want to go to Northern; it is ALL the things that we do here.  Northern is big enough to offer a wide variety of academic programs but is also small enough that every time you walk across campus, you'll probably wave ""hi"" to someone you know.

It causes us to ask questions, to seek answers, to learn. At Northern Michigan University, natural curiosity and intellectual challenge meet in stimulating classes grounded in the liberal arts. So wherever your curiosity leads you, you can count on the support you need to take the next step, ask the next question, propose the next hypothesis.        Safety     Marquette, home of Northern Michigan University, was ranked as one of the safest college towns in America, according to The SafeWise Report. Northern takes pride in having a campus that is caring, inclusive and ready to take action in light of safety concerns. Northern encourages students, employees and visitors to make themselves familiar with the resources and services available for assistance in matters of safety.

Health and Dental Insurance       Health and Dental Insurance         Health Insurance  By requiring students to have health plan coverage, the University ensures that all students have access to medical care and can maintain good health, which is essential for academic success.  All students who are 1) admitted to a degree program, and 2) registered for six or more credits per semester (or three or more credits during summer term) that count toward the automatic assessment of the Student Services Fee, are required by the University of Minnesota to have health plan coverage. Students who meet both of these criteria are eligible for enrollment in the University-sponsored Student Health Benefit Plan (SHBP) .  Eligible students are automatically enrolled in the University-sponsored Student Health Benefit Plan. Students may waive enrollment in the SHBP by providing verifiable health plan information per the instructions during registration and/or found online at www.shb.umn.edu . If the student’s health plan coverage is not verifiable, the student will be automatically enrolled (if eligible) and the student’s University account will be charged the full, non-refundable semester coverage fee. Health plan information provided by students is subject to a periodic audit. If a student fails to provide proof of active, verifiable health plan coverage by the enrollment deadline, the student will be automatically enrolled in the University-sponsored SHBP for the entire semester. Coverage must be in force the first day of classes.  The University of Minnesota requires all international students and their dependents to purchase the University-sponsored SHBP unless they are eligible for a waiver. At the time international students arrive at the University of Minnesota, they will have their documents validated. International students must enroll in the University-sponsored SHBP (or provide proof of coverage eligible to waive the plan) at that time and remain enrolled until the date they leave the University. The cost of the plan will be charged to their University account and must be paid along with their tuition and fees.  Non-degree seeking, certificate-seeking, distance learning, EMBA, PTMBA, and Continuing Education students are not eligible to enroll in the University-sponsored SHBP.

Medical Records  If you need access to specific medical records you must submit a Consent to Release Health Information to SMSU Health Services. Immunization information submitted by the student cannot be duplicated or released as it is a 'self-report' form rather than an original document of the medical record completed within Health Services.

You are here Home › Campus Facilities and Services › Main Campus        Health Center      WELCOME TO THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER  At the Student Health Center, we believe you should develop personal responsibility for your health during your years at MVSU.  Staying healthy will give you a competitive edge, both now and in the future.  Maximize your education at the MVSU by improving you health and staying healthy.  Mission & Goal  The Student Health Center does not exist to replace the student's private physician, but is primarily organized to provide affordable education and preventive healthcare and health maintenance.  Students benefit from services that are at decreased or no cost.  This prevents the need of the student to leave campus to seek care, which results in medical bills which financially burden the students.   STUDENT HEALTH CENTER (Infirmary)  The Health Center provides educational and preventative health care to the student body of Mississippi Valley State University. Contractual medical services are provided by a licensed physician. Student patients are referred to outside entities as required by individual cases.

                                    purposes. To help clarify these terms, here are some definitions:   "" PHI"" refers to information in your health record that could identify you. All medical
                                    records and other individually identifiable health information used or disclosed by
                                    a health care provider in the course of treatment, payment or normal operations is

                                    as oral communication.  "" Treatment, Payment, and Health Care Operations""   - Treatment is when we provide, coordinate or manage your health care and other services
                                 related to your health care. An example of treatment would be when the UHC clinical
                                 staff consults with one another or with a health care provider outside of the University
                                 Health Center, such as your family physician, to decide on a plan of care for you.
                                 The pharmacy staff may need to use protected health information in order to consult
                                 with the provider(s) and his/her staff for clarification or consultation, or when
                                 transferring a prescription to another pharmacy at your request. The laboratory staff
                                 may need to use protected health information in order to consult with the ordering
                                 provider and his/her staff for clarification or consultation.  - Payment is when we obtain reimbursement for your healthcare. Examples of payment
                                 are when we disclose your PHI to your health insurer to obtain reimbursement for your
                                 health care or to determine eligibility or coverage. Charges posted to your university
                                 account do not contain protected health information.  - Health Care Operations are activities that relate to the performance and operation
                                 of UHC. Examples of health care operations are quality assessment and improvement
                                 activities, business-related matters such as audits and administrative services, and
                                 case management and care coordination.   "" Use "" applies only to activities within UHC, such as sharing, employing, applying,
                                    utilizing, examining, and analyzing information that identifies you.  "" Disclosure "" applies to activities outside of UHC, such as releasing, transferring,
                                    or providing access to information about you to other parties. In general, disclosures
                                    of information will be limited to the minimum necessary for the purpose of the disclosure.
                                    However, this provision does not apply to the disclosure of medical records for treatment
                                    purposes because physicians, specialists, and other providers may need access to the
                                    full record to provide quality care.   With few exceptions, protected health information cannot be released to any member
                                 of your family, nor can it be released to university administration, faculty or staff
                                 outside of the University Health Center without your explicit consent. See Section
                                 3 for those instances in which neither your consent nor authorization is required
                                 to release information.  If you request that the University Health Center mail, fax or otherwise send specific
                                 protected health information to another health care provider, you will be asked to
                                 sign a release of information consent form, which will be maintained in your health
                                 record. The University Health Center will provide (or send) a copy of your immunization
                                 record to an employer, educational institution or others as designated by you, per
                                 your telephone request. All other requests for information will require your written
                                 consent as noted above.  2. Uses and Disclosures Requiring Authorization  UHC may use or disclose PHI for purposes outside of treatment, payment, or health
                                 care operations when your appropriate authorization is obtained. An "" authorization""
                                 is written permission for specific disclosures. In those instances when we are asked
                                 for information for purposes outside of treatment, payment or health care operations,
                                 UHC will obtain an authorization from you before releasing this information.  You may revoke all such authorizations of PHI at any time, provided each revocation
                                 is in writing. You may not revoke an authorization to the extent that (1) UHC has
                                 relied on that authorization; or (2) if the authorization was obtained as a condition
                                 of obtaining insurance coverage, law provides the insurer the right to contest the
                                 claim under the policy.  3. Uses and Disclosures with Neither Consent nor Authorization  UHC may use or disclose PHI without your consent or authorization in the following
                                 circumstances. UHC will use or disclose the minimum information necessary to serve
                                 these purposes and only when it is essential to do so.   Child Abuse - If we have reasonable cause to suspect that a child has been or may
                                    be subjected to abuse or neglect, or if we observe a child being subjected to conditions
                                    that would reasonably result in abuse or neglect, UHC must immediately report such
                                    information to the Missouri Division of Family Services. UHC must also report sexual
                                    abuse or molestation of a child under 18 years of age to Family Services. UHC may
                                    also report child abuse or neglect to a law enforcement agency or juvenile office.  Adult and Domestic Abuse - If we have reasonable cause to suspect that an eligible
                                    adult (defined below) presents a likelihood of suffering physical harm or is in need
                                    of protective services, UHC must report such information to the Missouri Department
                                    of Social Services.   ""Eligible adult"" means any person 60 years of age or older, or an adult with a handicap
                                 (substantially limiting mental or physical impairment) between the ages of 18 and
                                 59 who is unable to protect his or her own interests or adequately perform or obtain
                                 services which are necessary to meet his or her essential human needs.   Health Oversight Activities - The Missouri Attorney General's Office may subpoena
                                    records from UHC relevant to disciplinary proceedings and investigations, such as
                                    those conducted by the Missouri Board of Nursing, Pharmacy or Healing Arts.  Judicial and Administrative Proceedings - If you are involved in a court proceeding
                                    and a request is made for information about your diagnosis or treatment and the records
                                    thereof, such information is privileged under state law, and UHC will not release
                                    information without written authorization from you, or in response to a court order.
                                    The privilege does not apply when you are being evaluated by a third party or where
                                    the evaluation is court-ordered. We will inform you in advance if this is the case.  Serious Threat to Health or Safety - When we judge that disclosure is necessary to
                                    protect against a clear and substantial risk of imminent serious harm being inflicted
                                    by you on yourself or another person, UHC must disclose your relevant confidential
                                    information to the appropriate professional workers, public authorities, the potential
                                    victim, his or her family, or your family.  Claims - If you file a worker's compensation claim, UHC must permit your record to
                                    be copied by the Missouri Labor and Industrial Commission or the Division of Worker's
                                    Compensation of the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, your employer,
                                    you and any other party to the proceedings. If you assert a claim against UCM it may
                                    be necessary to share PHI with legal counsel.  In complying with public health policy - All health care providers are required to
                                    comply with federal, state and local public health reporting requirements. These include,
                                    but are not limited to, reporting some communicable sexually transmitted diseases,
                                    including HIV infection. Public health authorities, in turn, have the responsibility
                                    of protecting your private health information from unlawful exposure.  In complying with local, state, and federal regulatory requirements - Examples include
                                    inspectors from the Department of Health, Missouri Board of Pharmacy, the Drug Enforcement
                                    Agency, the Federal Aviation Administration, and others.   4. Your Rights and Our Duties  Your Rights:   Right to Request Restrictions - You have the right to request restrictions on certain
                                    uses and disclosures of protected health information. However, UHC is not required
                                    to agree to a restriction you request.  Right to Receive Confidential Communications by Alternative Means and at Alternative
                                    Locations - You have the right to request and receive confidential communications
                                    of PHI by alternative means and at alternative locations. (For example, you may not
                                    want a family member to know that you are being seen at UHC. On your request, we will
                                    send your bills to another address.)  Right to Inspect and Copy - You have the right to inspect or obtain a copy (or both)
                                    of PHI in UHC health and billing records used to make decisions about you for as long
                                    as the PHI is maintained in the record. UHC may ask you to pay for the cost of copying
                                    and mailing your record. UHC may deny your access to PHI under certain circumstances,
                                    but you may have this decision reviewed. On your request, the Director of University
                                    Health Services will discuss with you the details of the review process.  Right to Amend - You have the right to request an amendment of PHI for as long as
                                    the PHI is maintained in the record. UHC may deny your request. On your request, the
                                    Director of Campus Community Health will discuss with you the details of the amendment
                                    process.  Right to an Accounting - You generally have the right to receive an accounting of
                                    disclosures of PHI. On your request, the Director of Campus Community Health will
                                    discuss with you the details of the accounting process.  Right to a Paper Copy of this Notice - You have the right to obtain a paper copy (or
                                    an electronic copy, if you prefer) of the Privacy Notice from UHC upon request. Ask
                                    any member of the administrative staff for assistance.   Our Duties:   UHC is required by law to maintain the privacy of PHI and to provide you with a notice
                                    of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to PHI.  UHC reserves the right to change the privacy policies and practices described in this
                                    notice. Unless UHC notifies you of such changes, however, UHC is required to abide
                                    by the terms currently in effect.  If UHC revises our policies and procedures, the revised version will be made available
                                    to you at you",0.002808023,0.00286499,Other Class

Highly Recommended Immunizations:   Measles/Mumps, Rubella (MMR)  Tetanus-Diphtheria-acelluar pertussis (Tdap)  MenB  Hepatitis A  Hepatitis B  Varicella (Chickenpox)  Polio  Influenza  HPV for females   Cost  It is the policy of Missouri Western State University to provide low-cost health services to all registered students. At this time MWSU students do not pay a health fee at registration. Therefore, it is necessary to charge a nominal fee for services, laboratory and medications.  Students will not be denied health services because of their inability to pay at the time services are provided.  Charges will be added to the student’s account with the MWSU Business Office.  The health center does not file insurance claims.  We file ONLY International Student Insurance. It is recommended that you check with your insurance company to see how your policy works while you are attending MWSU. We will provide documentation of all charges so that you may submit them to your insurance company if desired.

Measles – a very contagious viral infection spread through coughing and sneezing. It is also known as rubeola, five-day measles, or hard measles. Measles feature a reddish skin rash. Women who contract measles while pregnant may give birth to a baby with hearing problems. The most serious consequence of measles is encephalitis (inflammation of the brain).  Mumps – a very contagious disease characterized by swelling of the salivary glands. It spreads easily in schools by coughing, sneezing and direct contact. After adolescence, mumps tend to affect the ovaries and the testes. The mature testis is particularly susceptible to damage which can lead to infertility.  Rubella – a highly contagious viral disease, also called German measles, is spread through contact with discharges from the nose and throat. Symptoms include swollen glands, joint pain, low-grade fever and a fine red rash. Rubella can have serious complications for pregnant women including miscarriage or severe birth defects.  The MMR immunization is recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Information available at: https://health.mo.gov/index.php  Close × Meningococcal Disease (Meningitis)  Meningitis is a contagious, potentially fatal infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. If not treated, meningitis can lead to permanent complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends two doses of MCV4 for adolescents. The first dose at 11 or 12 years old, with a booster dose at 16. For those who receive the first dose at 13 through 15 years of age, a booster dose is recommended at 16 through 18. For those who receive the first dose after 16, no booster dose is needed.  This immunization is mandated by Missouri State Law and is required for all on-campus residency.  Close × Tetanus-Diphtheria-Pertusis (Tdap) Boosters are recommended every 10 years and may be indicated more frequently for certain injuries.  Tetanus – an infection of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). This disease is rare but often fatal. Tetanus is caused when bacterium enter the body through unclean wounds or cuts.  Diphtheria – a highly contagious disease spread by direct physical contact or by sneezing or coughing. Diphtheria is an upper respiratory tract illness characterized by sore throat, low-grade fever and fatigue.  Pertussis – also known as “whooping cough” is a highly communicable infectious disease. It is most commonly spread through contact with respiratory droplets and less commonly through contact with recently contaminated item from an infected person. The incidence of pertussis remains a significant public health threat with a steadily increasing number of cases during the past two decades. Close × Hepatitis A  A highly contagious viral infection resulting in inflammation of the liver and its ability to function. Hepatitis A is generally transmitted from contaminated food or water or from close contact with a person or object that’s infected. The vaccine is typically given in two shots. The first one is followed by a booster shot six months later.  Close × Hepatitis B  A serious viral infection resulting in inflammation of the liver that may later lead to cancer of the liver or other serious complications. Hepatitis B is generally transmitted by contact with body fluids from an infected person. A series of three immunizations over a seven month period can prevent hepatitis B.  Close × Varicella (chickenpox)  A common childhood disease that is usually mild, but can be serious in young infants and adults. Chickenpox is spread through the air or by contact with fluid from chickenpox blisters. Symptoms include a rash, itching, fever, and tiredness. Chickenpox can lead to severe skin infection, scars, pneumonia, brain damage or death. Individuals who contract chickenpox will always be at risk of developing a very painful and serious rash called shingles years later. Vaccination is recommended for anyone who has not had chickenpox.  Close × Influenza  A contagious disease caused by a virus which spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing. For most people, it lasts only a few days. Symptoms include fever, sore throat, chills, fatigue, cough, headache and muscle aches. A yearly influenza vaccination should be considered for people living in dormitories or under other crowded conditions to prevent outbreaks.  Close × Pneumococcal disease (pneumonia)  Pneumonia is a serious disease that can lead to life-threatening infections of the lungs, blood or covering of the brain and can cause death. Drugs such as penicillin, that were once effective in treating pneumococcal disease, have become more resistant often making treatment difficult. This makes prevention of the disease through vaccination even more important.  Close × HPV (human papillomavirus) The most common sexually transmitted virus in the U.S. HPV can cause cervical cancer in some women. HPV can also cause genital warts and warts in the upper respiratory tract of both men and women. More than 50% of sexually active men and women are infected with HPV at sometime in their lives. The HPV vaccine, called Gardasil, can prevent most genital warts and most cases of cervical cancer. Gardasil is given between 9 – 26 years of age. Gardasil is given in a 3-dose series over a six-month period. Close × Polio  Polio is a contagious viral illness that in its most severe form causes nerve injury leading to paralysis, difficulty breathing and sometimes death. Most children in the United States receive four doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) at the ages of two months, four months, between 6 and 18 months and between ages 4 and 6 when children are just entering school.  Close × Tuberculosis Screening/Testing FAQ Why do I need to complete this screening & follow up testing?  The purpose of the tuberculosis (TB) screening is to promote the optimum health of affected individuals through prompt diagnosis and treatment of TB while preventing potential spread to others. A comprehensive screening and targeted testing program not only addresses this public health condition in the campus community but also contributes to the larger public health goal of reducing the burden of TB in the United States. This policy is in compliance with Missouri State Law and the American College Health Association recommendations.  I answered “yes” to a question on the TB questionnaire form. Do I need a TB test?  If you answered “Yes” to question 1 (regarding a past positive TB test), you should NOT get another TB skin test. See FAQ #5 .  If you answered “Yes” to questions 2, 3, 4 or 5, you are required to provide documentation of further testing and evaluation by a certified U.S. Healthcare Provider, prior to attending classes or working on campus.  Which TB test should I get?  You can get either a TB skin test, or a TB blood test. The only acceptable skin test is the PPD tuberculin 5 T.U. (Mantoux TB test). We do not accept multiple puncture tests such as TINE, Monovac and so on. If you cannot get the Mantoux test, you should get a TB blood test, such as the Quantiferon or T-Spot, or any other IGRA (interferon-gamma release assay) test.  How should the TB skin test be documented?  TB test results must be read within 48 to 72 hours after administration and signed by a healthcare professional. A positive result must be documented in mm. of induration; we cannot accept a simple reading of “positive” or “negative”. The test date must be within 6 months of arrival on campus.  I have had a positive TB skin test in the past (screening question 1), but have already received treatment. What do I do?  You will need to provide all documentation of a prior or current course of TB testing, treatment and/or medication.  If I need a TB test and have had the BCG vaccine what are the next steps?  The BCG vaccine can cause a false positive with a TB skin test, so it is recommended that you receive a TB blood test.  If you have received a positive TB skin test you will be required to provide documentation of a negative chest x-ray and be without symptoms.  What does “close contact” mean? (Screening question #3)  No definition or guideline exists as to what is a “significant” TB exposure. The degree of communicability of TB from one person to another depends on many factors:   intimacy of exposure  duration of exposure  quantity of bacilli discharged  infectivity of the bacilli  ventilation  exposure of the bacilli to sun or ultraviolet light  opportunities for aerosolization through coughing, sneezing, talking, singing  immune status of the person being exposed   The CDC defines a contact as “a person who has spent time with a person with infectious TB.” CDC recommends that persons should get tested for TB if they have spent time with a person known or suspected to have active TB disease, if they have HIV infection, or if they have another condition that weakens their immune system and puts them at higher risk for active TB disease.  The CDC indicates that persons who had prolonged, frequent, or intense contact with a person with TB while he or she was infectious are considered to be exposed. Close contacts are more likely to become infected with M. tuberculosis than contacts who see the person with TB less often. CDC indicates that exposure related to households, congregate living settings, or cough-inducing medical procedures, are designated as higher risk. Because knowledge is insufficient for providing exact recommendations, cut-off points for duration of exposure are not included.  I have been out of the country for more than 2 months—but it was years ago. Do I still need a TB test?  Only if the country is a high risk area listed on the TB Screening Questionnaire will a TB test or further documentation be required. You will be responsible for providing documentation of further testing and evaluation by a certified U.S. Healthcare Provider, prior to attending classes or working on campus.  Where can I get the test?  Students can get the test at the Esry Student Health Center, located on the second floor of the Blum Union, on Missouri Western State University campus; or any U.S. Healthcare Provider can administer the test.  Faculty & Staff can get the test at any U.S. Healthcare Provider. Additionally, the City of St. Joseph Missouri Health Department Services also administers it.  The City of St. Joseph Missouri Health Department is located at 904 South 10th St. in St. Joseph. Their phone number is (816) 271-4636. TB testing for employment purposes or for medical history without a known exposure to an active TB case is available for a $12 charge, Monday, Tuesday and Friday, from 8:00–11:00 a.m. & 1:00–4:00 p.m. (no appointments, walk-in only). You must be able to return in 48-72 hours later to have the test checked.  See more information at http://www.stjoemo.info/index.aspx?nid=487  Close × No-Show Policy  All students who schedule an appointment for services at the Esry Student Health Center will be charged a “no-show” fee of $5.00 if they miss their scheduled appointment. The fee will be placed on their Missouri Western account. If they call before the time of appointment to cancel or reschedule, they will not be charged. The definition of “no-show” is a person who made a reservation, a booking or an appointment but neither keeps nor cancels.  Student Appeal Process: Students may appeal the “no-show” fee within the semester of missing the appointment. A written explanation needs to be given, stating the reason you feel your missed appointment fee should be credited. “No-Show” Fee Appeal Form  Close × Medical Emergencies Esry Student Health Center is neither staffed nor equipped to manage severe medical emergencies.  In the event of a medical emergency call 911 and request that an ambulance be dispatched; then notify Campus Police at (816) 271-4438 so they can assist with routing of emergency vehicles, traffic control, etc.  Please note that campus personnel cannot provide transportation for emergencies or referral services.

My name is Wanda Meredith
                                 and I am a registered nurse. This is my first year at MSU-Northern however I have
                                 worked as an RN for quite some time and have worked in hospital nursing as well as
                                 public health. Here is a little information about what Student Health Services provides.  There are two medical providers that come to the clinic, one on Tuesday morning from
                                 10:30 AM to 12 noon, and the other on Thursday afternoon from 1 PM to 2:30 PM. Our
                                 site is set up like a doctor's office and they are able to evaluate and diagnose students
                                 in the same manner they would at the doctor's office. There is no cost for the visit, however , any tests may be a charge. If you need further testing, you will be sent to another
                                 location to have this done. This would need to be billed to your insurance, so it
                                 will be important you have your insurance card available to present at that facility
                                 at the time of service.   Examples of services provided  We are conveniently located in the Student Union Building (SUB) room 228. All students
                              enrolled in six or more credits are eligible to use this service. It is my goal to
                              expand awareness of our services and to provide a safe, supportive, empowering atmosphere.  MSU-Northern is a member of the American College Health Association and follows the
                              policies and operating procedures recommended by the association.  I look forward to hopefully meeting you one day soon and thank you for checking out
                              this site. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at: 406-265-3599

Expand All  Collapse All     Coronavirus Information      About Coronavirus:  Here at NJCU, we are carefully tracking the coronavirus.  Since this discovery, NJCU has postponed all trips to China until the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that the virus is no longer a threat. In addition, the University is advising students, faculty or staff who have recently traveled to China on education abroad trips or on vacation for the holiday break to see their primary doctor immediately if they begin to experience flu-like symptoms.  The following information is designed to further inform you regarding the current status by the CDC and other details that may be helpful to you:  What is Coronavirus?  The CDC is closely monitoring an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus (termed “2019-nCoV”) that was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and which continues to expand. Chinese health officials have reported hundreds of infections with 2019-nCoV in China, including outside of Hubei Province. Infections with 2019-nCoV also are being reported in a growing number of countries internationally, including the United States, where the first 2019-nCoV infection was detected in a traveler returning from Wuhan on January 21, 2020.The 019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, suggesting person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, it’s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people.  Symptoms  Patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection have reportedly had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of:  Fever  Cough  Shortness of breath  The CDC believes at this time that symptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 after exposure. This is based on what has been seen previously as the incubation period of MERS viruses.  Transmission  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS and SARS.  When person-to-person spread has occurred with MERS and SARS, it is thought to have happened via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. Spread of SARS and MERS between people has generally occurred between close contacts.  It’s important to note that how easily a virus spreads person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so. It’s not clear yet how easily 2019-nCoV spreads from person-to-person. It’s important to know this in order to better understand the risk associated with this virus.  Prevention  There is currently no vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Right now, 2019-nCoV has not been found to be spreading in the United States, so there are no additional precautions recommended for the general public to take. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.  These are every day habits that can help prevent the spread of several viruses. CDC does have specific guidance for travelers.  Treatment  There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for 2019-nCoV infection. People infected with 2019-nCoV should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Here at NJCU, we are carefully tracking the coronavirus.  Since this discovery, NJCU has postponed all trips to China until the CDC reports that the virus is no longer a threat. In addition, the University has alerted students who have recently traveled to China on education abroad trips or on vacation for the holiday break to see their primary doctor immediately if they begin to experience flu-like symptoms.  Anyone who believes they may have been exposed to 2019-nCoV should contact your healthcare provider immediately.

Health Clinics: Staffed by licensed Nurse Practitioners, Health Clinics are located on the Macon and Cochran campuses. These facilities are medical clinics providing a broad range of affordable health care to currently enrolled MGA students, who have paid the Health fee, on all five campuses. A valid MGA Knight ID card is required. Health Clinic services are available by appointments, which are strongly encouraged; walk-ins will be seen as time permits. Unlimited visits to the clinics are free to students seeking treatment for episodic/acute illnesses. Other services including limited immunizations, lab testing, physicals, etc., are available for additional fees.  Current Parents: The health clinic understands you may worry about your students health and well being, and we encourage you to have an open relationship with your student when it comes to their health care. However, as health care providers, we must follow FERPA,  HIPPA and Patient's Rights guidelines. This means the health clinic is unable to discuss any information regarding your son or daughter, if they are 18 years or older. We ask you please refer to the HIPPA and Privacy Guideline tabs at the top of this page for any clarification on this matter.

If you have traveled to a country with an outbreak of COVID-19 and are at higher risk  Please visit the UMW Coronavirus FAQ for information.   PREVENT REGISTRATION HOLD     All entering first-time students (including transfer students), taking nine or more credits, MUST submit Health Information, Immunization, and Tuberculosis Screening forms to the Student Health Center.   UMW Health History, Immunization and TB Screening forms : The Health Information form is to be completed by the student or guardian. The Immunization and Tuberculosis Screening sections need to be verified and signed by a healthcare provider . All forms need to be completed and submitted to the Student Health Center by August 1st if your enrollment starts in the Fall Semester, January  3rd if your enrollment starts in the Spring Semester, or May 1st if your enrollment starts in the Summer Semester.  General Information   The Student Health Center (SHC) is a weekday health clinic for UMW students. Our care focuses on routine and acute health care needs of our student population.  This would include initial diagnosis and treatment of acute illnesses and/or injuries with appropriate follow up for most short-term illnesses.  On site specialty care includes reproductive and sexual health services , allergy clinic, travel consultations, and some immunizations.  Our providers are experienced in treating common medical problems seen on college campuses and are advocates of a holistic approach to health care.  We hope to empower students to become partners in managing their health/wellness needs through education and prevention.  The SHC provides in house rapid tests for Strep, urinalysis, urine pregnancy, influenza, and Mono-spot.  If any blood draw or x-rays are needed, these services are available at nearby local facilities and will be billed to student’s insurance.  There is an on-site pharmacy that has some basic generic medications that can be dispensed when ordered by our physician.  For the convenience of our students, the SHC provides samples of common over-the-counter (OTC) medications in our Self Care Room and at appointments.  Their Student Account or Eagle One Card will be charged a nominal fee for medication dispensed, tests, or procedures done at the visit.  Written prescription given to students can be filled and paid for at any local pharmacy.  In the event a student requires emergency or specialized medical care, the SHC staff will assist the student in making that process as smooth as possible.  The SHC does not participate in any insurance plans and thus cannot do any medication and/or specialist prior authorization.  While insurance is not required to be seen in the SHC, it is highly encouraged as it will decrease out-of-pocket costs and stress if outside services are needed.  Students are treated in compliance with FERPA/HIPAA regulations, maintaining complete confidentiality.  Their medical information can only be released after a written request has been submitted.  If you have a medical concern, please call to make an appointment.  Walk-ins are welcome, and are seen on a first come first served basis.   BE PREPARED:  When leaving home for the first time, it is hard to think of everything you might need.  Check out our list of easily forgotten items that may make life easier.

The “flu” is caused by the Influenza virus and is generally more severe than the common cold. If identified and treated quickly, antiviral medications are available to shorten the duration and severity of the illness.  The common cold may be treated with over-the-counter medications. Unfortunately, Vitamin C and other cold remedies have been shown to be pretty ineffective in treating, preventing or shortening the common cold.  The best thing you can do is to take care of yourself by drinking plenty of fluids, resting and washing your hands frequently to prevent the spread of illness.  Influenza can be prevented with an annual flu shot . If you find yourself sick with symptoms of the flu, contact the Student Health Center or your medical provider as soon as possible.  See Chart of Symptoms     Health and wellness are vital to student learning, retention, and success. The mission of the Student Health Center is to support student well-being by providing compassionate, professional, individualized, and cost-effective health care and wellness services to our diverse student population.
