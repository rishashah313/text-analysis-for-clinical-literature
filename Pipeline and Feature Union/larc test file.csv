Emergency contraceptive pills are not available in the Wellness Center.  The pill can be purchased over the counter at the pharmacy without a prescription . This service is available through the Healthy Teen Center at 301-324-5141. Although recommended to be given within 72 hours , recent published literature indicates that EC (emergency contraception) is effective even up to five days post-incident . The sooner it is given, the better . The number 1-888-not-2-late is a toll-free number that gives ECP options and resources.  When is emergency contraception appropriate?  No contraceptive method is 100% effective, and few couples can use their method perfectly every time they have intercourse. Emergency contraception provides an important safety net when:   A condom breaks  No contraceptive is used  A woman misses two or more contraceptive pills in a row or starts a new pack two or more days late  A diaphragm or cervical cap slips out of place  A woman is more than two weeks late for a contraceptive injection  Intercourse occurs unexpectedly and without contraceptive protection  A woman is raped   Emergency Contraception is not a substitute for regular contraceptive use. It is less effective than regular contraception (used correctly) and provides no protection from HIV or sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, in emergency situations, it can play an important role as a backup for other methods. It is second-chance contraception.

Annual Exams  Annual women’s health exams are offered.  All sexually active women and all women age 21 years and older are encouraged to have an annual exam visit.  At the annual exam visit, the Nurse Practitioner will take a detailed health history and makes an assessment of current health status, risk for sexually transmitted infections (STI) and contraceptive needs.  The annual women’s physical exam includes a general physical including an examination of the breasts and if deemed necessary for your individual needs a pelvic exam.  The decision to do a pelvic exam, STI and pap testing is based on the individual risk factors, current symptoms and current pap screening guidelines.  Women can also have screening blood and urine tests ordered as appropriate.  Breast Health  Many women have questions about their breast health.  There is a wide range of normal breast sizes and shapes, as well as variations month to month in healthy women.  It is important that all women are familiar with their breasts and are encouraged to perform self-breast exams on a regular basis.  The breast exam is part of the woman’s annual exam.  If you have concerns about your breast health, such as lumps, nipple changes, breast pain or other problems, please schedule an appointment with the Well Women’s Clinic so that these concerns can be addressed.  Contraception / Birth Control  The Well Women’s Clinic offers counseling on contraceptive options.  The range of contraceptive options can be confusing and the decision is an important one.  We are happy to meet with you to discuss any and all of your birth control or contraception questions in order that you make the best informed decision about your needs.  Remember only abstinence can claim 100% effectiveness but used correctly, the following contraceptive options can provide safe effective birth control for the sexually active student.  Remember that condoms when used properly are the only method shown to reduce the spread of STIs.  Contraceptive Methods:   Hormonal methods (pills, patches rings, injections)  Condoms with other barrier method  Diaphragm  Cervical Cap  Spermicidal  IUD  Withdrawal  Sterilization  Abstinence   Emergency Contraception or “Morning After Pill”  Emergency Contraception-Web Page Info Update 9_15  Menstruation  Many women have questions regarding their menstrual cycle.  The Well Women’s Clinic is here to answer your questions and address your concerns.  Knowing what a normal menstrual cycle is can be very helpful.  A typical healthy young woman will have a menstrual period about every 28 – 32 days.  The length of the cycle is counted from the first day of bleeding until the next month’s bleeding begins.  The number of days a woman bleeds can range from 1 to 8 days.  Some women experience menstrual cramps with their menstrual cycle.  These cramps can range from mild to severe (dysmenorrhea.)  Severe menstrual cramps can be very difficult to deal with and pose a significant health concern for women who suffer from them.  Some women also experience significant mood disorders such as depression and anxiety associated with their menstrual cycle or the 2 weeks prior to their cycle.  Other menstrual problems can include heavy bleeding, irregular cycles, bleeding in between cycles and late cycles.  In young women the most common reason for a late or irregular cycle is pregnancy.  It is important that you talk to a health care provider if you are experiencing any problems with your menstrual cycle.  Pap Smear and Human Papilloma Virus Testing  Pap Smear screening tests are usually done at the annual women’s health exam.  The test looks for changes in the cervix caused by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection.  The first Pap test is recommended at age 21 unless the woman is sexually active.  Guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that women begin Pap test screening at age 21, be screened every 2 years through age 30, and then be screened every 3 years as long as their last three test results have been normal. If the Pap test shows abnormalities, further tests and/or treatment may be necessary. Women who have been vaccinated against HPVs still need to have Pap tests.  Students can schedule an appointment with the Well Women’s Clinic for this exam and testing.  Human Papilloma Virus and HPV Vaccine  Women and men can pass HPV to their sexual partners by having vaginal, anal or oral sexual activity.  HPV can cause genital wants and almost all cervical cancer is caused by HPV infection.  HPV can also cause cancers of the vulvar, vagina, mouth, throat, penis, anus and rectum.  The HPV vaccine is not currently available through the Well Women’s Clinic.  However, a prescription can be provided for this medication.  The woman can then return to the Well Women’s Clinic for the administration of the vaccine.  The HPV vaccine provides protection from the two types of HPV that cause over 70% of cervical cancers and the two types that cause 90% of genital warts.  The vaccine is recommended for women between the ages of 9 and 26 years.  It still has not been approved for administration to women over age 29 or to men.               505 Ramapo Valley Road Mahwah, NJ 07430  p: 201-684-7500 e: information@ramapo.edu      About Ramapo  Academics  Admissions & Aid  Student Life  Alumni  Community Programs       Bookstore  Jobs  Intranet  Web Self-Service  Ramapo A-Z  Contact Us        Twitter   Facebook   YouTube   Flickr   Instagram   RSS    Visit  Apply               Copyright ©2019 Ramapo College Of New Jersey.

Safer Sex  Safer sex is about more than staying healthy. It includes protecting yourself and your partner(s) from sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintentional pregnancy. This means utilizing contraception correctly and consistently and assessing your risk for STIs from sex (vaginal, anal, and oral) and intimate skin-to-skin contact. But it’s also about affirmative consent, body positivity and self-love, communicating openly with your partner(s), finding out what you like and what you don’t like, and being comfortable and confident in however you choose to express your sexuality.  A nnual Gynecological Visit  Regular gynecological visits are an important part of maintaining your overall health and taking responsibility for your reproductive and sexual health. The visit includes a review of your medical history, discussion of any symptoms or problems (such as irregular periods or vaginal discharge) and assessment of your need for contraception. An examination will be done, including necessary STI testing and cancer screening. A pelvic exam may or may not be necessary. This can be discussed with your clinician during the visit.       Contraception  We offer a full range of contraceptive health services including:   Consultation: We work with you to determine which method of birth control is best suited to you and your lifestyle.  Prescriptions: If applicable, we provide prescriptions for hormonal contraception, which can be filled at the Rutgers Student Health Pharmacies.  Insertion: We provide insertion of Long Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC) devices such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants (Nexplanon) as well as follow up visits, if needed.  Pregnancy Counseling: We provide counseling regarding pregnancy options, referrals for prenatal care, and referrals for pregnancy terminations.        Male Reproductive and Sexual Health  We provide male genital exams, testing/treatment for STIs and evaluation of erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation.

Annual exams begin with an evaluation of the thyroid, breasts, and abdomen. The pelvic exam includes inspection of the vulva, vagina, cervix, and palpation of the uterus and ovaries. Pap test are added beginning at age 21. Screening for sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, can be done as well.  How do I prepare for my exam?  Plan your pelvic exam on a day you will not have your period.Â Woman should not douche. But if you do, donâ€™t douche for at least 24 hours.Â Make a list of questions you want to ask your provider.  48 hours before your exam do not have intercourse or place tampons or medication in the vagina. This will ensure a more accurate assessment of the vaginal walls and the cervix.  What if I have an urgent problem? Same day appointments are offered based on availability.Â  Symptoms may include:   Menstrual cramps  Abdominal pain  Severe PMS  Irregular periods  Abnormal discharge,  Pain, swelling, or tenderness of the vulva or vagina  Sores, lumps, or itching of the vulva or vagina  Severe or unusual vaginal or pelvic pain    Birth Control  Most contraceptive methods requiring a prescription are available.   Birth control pills  NuvaRing (birth control vaginal ring)  Ortho Evra Patch (birth control patch)  Depo-Provera (injectable contraception)  Diaphragm (non-hormonal barrier/spermicidal method)   We provide long acting reversible birth control including IUDâ€™s and Nexplanon (the birth control arm implant). We also provide counseling for birth control options and have many other options available as well. Please note: the fees and insurance coverage will be different when you receive care outside of University Health Services.  Getting started on birth control:  Woman requesting a birth control method that requires a prescription need to have a contraceptive consultation. Â An exam is not required to start birth control, but is recommended if you have been sexually active or over the age of 21.  Getting refills of birth control when prescribed by an outside clinician:  Written prescriptions for your birth control method from a non UHS clinician can be filled at the UHS Pharmacy . In order to comply with public health regulations, patients obtaining their prescriptions from UHS need to be under the care of a UHS provider.Â Prescriptions coming from a non UHS clinician may need to be rewritten by the UHS provider.  UHS must receive a copy of your recent pap smear (if applicable, within the past 12 months) from your clinician's office. This can be accomplished by:   Faxing pap report to University Health Services at 513-556-1337  Mailing pap report to: University Health Services University of Cincinnati PO Box 210010 Cincinnati, OH 45221-0010  Bringing in a copy of your pap report to University Health Services   If you do not have immediate access to your pap results, discuss this with a UHS nurse who will assist you with obtaining your results from your clinician. You will need to complete and sign a medical records release.  Once the pap report is obtained, you will need to schedule an appointment with a University Health Services provider for a Contraceptive Counseling office visit. This visit is covered for those who have UC Student Health Insurance. This can be done with an appointment at either UHS location.  At the time of your office visit, your blood pressure will be checkedÂ and you will be asked to complete a short oral contraceptive questionnaire. If the UHS provider determines there are no contraindications, you will be provided with a prescription for enough pill packs until your next pap is due.  Continuing Depo-Provera injections when prescribed by an outside clinician: If you use Depo-Provera and are due for an injection, UHS will give that injection if you provide medical documentation of the date of the previous shot. A copy of your most recent PAP test (if applicable) is also appreciated. Your health care provider can fax it to us at:   513-556-1337 (UHS Commons Edge North, Main Campus)  513-584-2222 (UHS Holmes Location, Medical Campus)   Please obtain your records to us before your visit so your care is not delayed.   Sexually Transmitted Infections  Many students seek out routine STI screening, even when they are not having symptoms, just to be sure they donâ€™t have an STI. This is important, since many infections do not cause symptoms.  Please call for an appointment for evaluation if you are sexually active and experiencing symptoms such as:   Unusual discharge  Sores  Bumps  Blisters  Bleeding between periods or after sex  Burning pain with urination  Pelvic pain    Emergency Contraceptive Pills  Emergency contraception, also known as Plan B or the morning after pill helps prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse or after the failure of regular method birth control. It may be effective up 72 hours after unprotected sex, although effectiveness decreases the longer you wait.  Emergency contraception is now available without a prescription if you are 17 years or older. If you are 17 or under, Plan B requires a prescription. It can be purchased by both males and females. Proof of age is required.   HPV Vaccine (GARDASIL)  HPV (human papillomavirus) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Most HPV infections donâ€™t cause any symptoms and go away on their own. However, the virus can cause genital warts, abnormal Pap tests results, and cervical cancer.  GARDASIL protects against four major types of possible 40 types of HPV. These include two types that cause about 70 percent of cervical cancer and two types that cause about 90 percent of genital warts. HPV vaccine can prevent most genital warts and most cases of cervical cancer.  The vaccine is safe and effective for males and females 9-26 years old, regardless of their sexual history. The HPV vaccine is given as a three-dose series, with the second and third dose given 2 and 6 months after the first dose.  Contact UHS nursing personnel to discuss cost and to schedule an appointment.   UHS Commons Edge North (Main Campus) 513-556-2564  UHS Holmes Location (Medical Campus) 513-584-4457    Pregnancy Testing and Counseling  University Health Services offers pregnancy testing, options counseling and referrals. A urine pregnancy test is usually accurate one or two days after a missed period, or 14 days after unprotected intercourse. There are also several pregnancy test kits available for use at home. The advantage of using a kit at home would be convenience and privacy. The disadvantages are the chance of error and the cost.  If you are concerned about a positive result or think you may be pregnant, you may want to sort out your feelings and clarify your options. Please remember, you do have choices and we will help in any way we can, no matter what your choice.  Same day appointments based on availability are available for pregnancy testing and counseling.   Sexual Violence  Services for victims of sexual assault are provided by the University Health Services regardless of the duration of time since the assault occurred. If the sexual assault occurred within the last 72 hours, you will be encouraged to seek care at University Hospital where evidence can be collected.  This does not require you to make a police report. If you choose to be seen at University Health Services, evidence will not be collected. Concerns about sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy will be addressed, as well as a discussion of resources and a plan for follow-up care.

Emergency contraception is a form of birth control. You can use this method if you have had unprotected sex. For example, if your regular birth control fails (the condom breaks during sex), if you forget to take your birth control pills or if you have sex without using any birth control.  Emergency contraception is available from health care providers. It is provided in two ways:  Emergency contraception pills (ECPs)  Insertion of an IUDÂ (Not available at Health and Wellness Services) You may want emergency contraception if  His condom broke or slipped  You forgot to take your birth control pills  Your diaphragm or cervical cap slipped out of place  You miscalculated your ""safe""days  You were not using any birth control  You had unprotected vaginal sex   Important! ECPs DO NOT protect against HIV or other sexually transmitted infections. You may want to consider testing for sexually transmitted infections if there is a possibility that unprotected sex put you at risk.  How do I use emergency contraception?  The first kind of emergency contraception, sometimes called the ""morning-after pill,"" is taken in two doses. You can start taking this kind of emergency contraception right away after having unprotected sex. The sooner you take it, the better it works, but you can take the first dose within three days (72 hours) after having unprotected sex. You take the second dose 12 hours after the first. Your doctor may tell you about other ways of taking this medicine.  There is a brand of pills made just for emergency contraception. It is called Plan B (levonorgestrel).  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also has said that some brands of regular birth control pills are safe for emergency use. The number of pills you take in each dose depends on which brand of pills you are using. To learn more about which pills are safe for emergency use, talk with your doctor.  An IUD that is placed in your uterus within 7 days after unprotected sex also can be used as emergency contraception. An IUD is a small device that can be left in your body for 5 to 10 years. It will prevent pregnancy during that time.  How does emergency contraception work?  Pills used for emergency contraception can prevent your ovaries from releasing an egg, can prevent an egg from being fertilized by sperm or can prevent a fertilized egg from attaching itself to the wall of the uterus. Emergency contraceptive pills are not the same as the medicine known as the ""abortion pill."" This medicine is taken in the early weeks of pregnancy to end the pregnancy. Pills used as emergency contraception can't end a pregnancy once a fertilized egg has attached itself to the wall of the uterus.  Unlike the morning-after pill, an IUD doesn't stop your ovaries from releasing an egg. The IUD can prevent an egg from being fertilized and it can stop a fertilized egg from attaching itself to the wall of the uterus.  No studies have shown that taking hormones while you are pregnant can hurt your baby. But, if you know you are pregnant, you should not take emergency contraception pills.  How effective is emergency contraception?  Emergency contraception pills can be very effective if they are used in time. If used within 72 hours of unprotected sex, it can reduce the risk of pregnancy by 75% to 89%. It is important to remember that these pills will work best when taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex.  Emergency IUD insertion is also very effective. It can reduce the risk of pregnancy by 99.9% if inserted within 7 days after unprotected sex.  It is important to remember that using this type of contraception regularly is less effective than using ongoing methods of contraception (like contraception pills or diaphragms). Emergency contraception should not be your main type of contraception.  After you take the pills    Your next period may be earlier or later than usual.  Your flow may be heavier, lighter, more spotty, or the same as usual.  If you see another health care provider before you get your period, remember to tell them that you have taken emergency contraception pills.  Schedule a follow-up visit with your health care provider if you don't have your period in three weeks or if you have symptoms of pregnancy.  Be sure to use another method of contraception if you have intercourse any time before you get your period again.  Continue using the birth control method of your choice for as long as you want to avoid pregnancy.  Risks and side effects  Nausea  Vomiting  Headaches  Breast tenderness  Dizziness  Fluid retention  Menstrual changes with heavier or lighter bleeding  Side effects associated with the use of ECPs usually taper off one or two days after the second dose has been taken. Frequent use of ECPs may cause periods to become irregular and unpredictable.The side effects of anti-nausea medication may include drowsiness.Please follow the precautions on the package insert.

In most appointments, a clinician will perform a general exam that includes listening to the heart and lungs, feeling the thyroid gland, checking the breasts, and checking abdominal organs. The clinician may also demonstrate how to perform a self-breast exam if the patient is not familiar with this practice. In addition, a pelvic exam is usually performed.  After the exam, the clinician will answer any questions. Results from the exam may not be available immediately. In most cases the patient will be notified by letter of pap smear results.     Click image for more information about exams             Who needs a gynecological exam? And, how often?      Unless you have a medical problem, you can wait to make an appointment for your first well-woman visit when you turn 21. After your first pelvic exam, your doctor will tell you when you need to come back. Itâ€™ll depend on your medical history and whether you have any health issues. Women who wish to use a prescription method of contraception should also have routine gynecological exams.  We recommend a yearly checkup and consultation regardless of your gender, sexual activity, or contraception needs. However, Pap smears are recommended every three years unless abnormal cells are found.               How do I pick the right contraception option?      There are many FDA-approved methods of contraception so it can be very difficult to pick the right one. A great tool to help select options is found here but always talk to a provider first. Things to consider when choosing an option include, but aren't limited to:   effectiveness  side effects  affect on menstrual cycle  STI prevention  hormone/hormone-free  cost  safe while breastfeeding  easy to use  cost  comfort  convenience      Click image to download our contraception brochure             What are the differences between hormonal and non-hormonal IUDs?      ""There are two kinds of IUDs available in the U.S.â€”with hormones and without. Both the Mirena and Skyla IUDs release a small amount of the synthetic hormone progestin to help your body keep sperm from reaching your cervix. Mirena lasts up to 5 years; Skyla is slightly smaller than Mirena and lasts up to 3 years.  The ParaGard IUD is hormone-free and doesnâ€™t alter your periods. Itâ€™s made of plastic and a small amount of natural, safe copper and can work for up to 12 years."" - Bedsider.org                 Will my parents know I made an appointment?

Whether you are seeking information about birth control or you need help selecting a method that is suitable to your health, lifestyle and relationship, our Registered Nurse or Advanced Practice Nurse can help. We carry most methods of birth control including birth control pills, the Depo Provera injection, the patch, NuvaRing, and male condoms; in addition, we can prescribe others such asÂ Mirena IUD and Implanon.  Emergency contraceptive, commonly known as the morning after pill, is also available over the counter for ages 17 and older. Emergency contraception can be used up to five days after unprotected intercourse, but the sooner is it used, the more effective it is at preventing pregnancy. For more information about emergency contraception, go to www.not-2-late.com    Chronic Disease Management  Our Family Practice Physician and Advanced Practice Nurse are available for the assessment, monitoring, and treatment of ongoing or chronic conditions-to the extent to which they are trained, and as long as it remains in the best interest of the student.

Men's Health  Sexual health problems of men may include concerns about sexuality, diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, urinary tract infections and prostate conditions. Men need to be as concerned about their sexual organs as women.

Oregon State is pleased to participate in Oregon Contraceptive Care (CCare)  This federal program provides free contraceptive management services, birth control, and reproductive health care to men and women.  If you qualify you will not be billed for contraceptive management services. Students who have health insurance (except Oregon Health Plan enrollees) can also enroll in CCare.   Frequently Asked Questions       No appointment needed.  SHS is staffed by highly qualified health professionals who provide confidential services to guide you to the best birth control method for your lifestyle.  Please feel free to contact the SHS CCare office with questions:  Call 541-737-9140  Stop by Plageman Building, Room 110C.   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS     What is CCare?      What is CCare?  CCare is a program that is funded by the Centers for Medicaid Services and the Oregon State Department of Human Services through a grant.  This allows Student Health Services to provide reproductive health care and contraceptive services to women and men who meet certain income criteria.       What services will CCare provide?     What services will CCare provide?  CCare will pay for contraceptive management office visits including birth control consultations, initiation and follow-up care, a yearly exam, and emergency contraception.       Where can I go for my contraceptives if I am not eligible for CCare?     Where can I go for my contraceptives if I am not eligible for CCare?  Labs, X-rays, and prescriptions can be billed to your student account.       Do I have to fill out a new enrollment form if I am renewing CCare?     Do I have to fill out a new enrollment form if I am renewing CCare?  Yes. Clients must complete a new enrollment form annually. This will enable us to determine if you are still eligible to receive CCare services.       Do I have to have an annual exam to start contraceptives?     Do I have to have an annual exam to start contraceptives?  No.Â You do not need to schedule an annual exam to discuss contraception. After your initial office visit, your clinician can determine whether you should have an annual exam.       What is the duration of eligibility for CCare?     What is the duration of eligibility for CCare?  Eligibility, once determined, will remain effective for one year (12 months) from the date of initial determination.  Eligibility determined at one site is accepted at all CCare and/or Planned Parenthood clinics in Oregon.       What if I don't qualify for CCare?     What if I don't qualify for CCare?  If you don't qualify for CCare and you have private insurance, your private insurance will be billed for contraceptive services, supplies and annual exams.  If you do not feel comfortable having your insurance billed, or your insurance does not cover contraceptive services, then a $5 administrative fee will be placed on your student account in addition to any fees for lab work or procedures.

If you meet these requirements, we can enroll you immediately and schedule an appointment for you to meet with a clinician, usually within a couple of days.  Separating contraceptive services and annual exams from Student Health Services' list of services covered by the health fee allows students who are eligible to enroll in the free CCare program.

What if I have insurance or am on my parentsâ€™ plan?  Students who have insurance that covers contraceptive management can still be eligible for the program if they meet the other criteria.  We will bill your insurance provider and then CCare as a secondary. You will not be charged.  However, if you are insured under your parentsâ€™ plan you may request special confidentiality.Â In this case no insurance billing will go out and CCare will cover all charges.

We hope that you will take advantage of this resource. Our major goal is to provide students with the support they need to maintain wellness and achieve academic success.    Students come to see us for a variety of reasons, including treatment for injuries, and treatment for acute illnesses such as the flu, sinus infections, skin infections, viral illnesses, urinary tract infections, and strep throat. We also provide preventive health services including well women exams/pap smears, contraception services, STD screening, and limited vaccine administration.    We do not provide after-hours emergency or urgent care coverage. In case of emergency, call 911. Alternate emergency resources are also available to students.    For a more detailed description of our services, please click on the quicklinks below.     Care for Acute Illnesses  If you are experiencing symptoms of an illness such as fever, sore throat, and cough and you wish to receive treatment, please call (731) 881-7750 for an appointment.  We can also evaluate injuries, skin rashes and lesions and other generalized complaints such as headaches, fatigue and malaise.  There is no fee associated with the office visit, but you may be charged a small fee for necessary lab work (strep test, mono test, urinalysis and so on) or medication.  If you are taking any prescription or over-the-counter medication, be sure and bring it with you to the appointment.     Allergy Shot Administration  Any eligible student to whom a physician has prescribed and dispensed a desensitizing antigen (""allergy shot"") for injection may receive the shots and store the supplies in SHCS. Allergy shots will be given only if written orders from the prescribing clinician are on file. Orders MUST include a dosage and administration schedule for each antigen or mixture.  Students must supply the serum and maintain primary responsibility for reordering serum.    Allergy shots will be administered only when a nurse practitioner is present. Patients must wait 20 minutes (or time specified in orders) after injection to be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions. A charge of $2.00 for one injection and $1.00 for each additional injection will be assessed with each visit unless the student supplies his or her syringes and needles. A student who receives a dose while at home during a break must present documentation from the administering clinician before continuing the injection schedule at SHCS. We will not give the initial dose.

You can get and pass STIs through vaginal, anal, and oral sex or during genital touching.  Do I need to be tested for sexually transmitted infections if I donâ€™t have any symptoms?  STI testing and treatment can help reduce the spread of STIs. It is important to have an honest and open talk about your sexual health, with your healthcare provider. Together we can help you make an informed decision about STI testing. Current CDC guidelines recommend:  All adults and adolescents from ages 13-64 should be tested at least once for HIV.  Annual chlamydia screening for all sexually active women age 25 and under.  Annual gonorrhea screening for at-risk sexually active women.  Syphilis, HIV, chlamydia, and hepatitis B screening for all pregnant women, and gonorrhea screening for at risk pregnant women.  Screening at least once a year for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea for all sexually active gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM).  Anyone who has unsafe sex or shares injection drug equipment should get tested for HIV at least once a year. High risk individuals may benefit from more frequent testing. Content source: Center for Disease Control and Prevention cdc.gov.  If you have questions or need an appointment, call the health center at 209-228-2273.  What are some of the symptoms of sexually transmitted infections?  Males often have no symptoms of STIs. If you do have symptoms, they might include a discharge from your penis, sores on your penis, pain and swelling in the testicles, and burning in your urethra.  How can I decrease my risk of sexually transmitted infections?  All men should take steps to lower their risk of STIs these may include:  Use condoms correctly and every time you have sex.  Know that certain birth control methods donâ€™t protect against STIs. Birth control methods including the pill, shots, implants, IUDs, diaphragms, and spermicides will not protect you from STIs. If your partner uses one of these methods, be sure to use a latex condom or dental dam correctly every time you have sex.  Talk with your partner(s) about STIs and using condoms before having sex. Setting the ground rules about testing and condom use will avoid future misunderstandings. It is up to you to make sure you are protected.  Get tested. If either you or your partner has had other sexual partners in the past, get tested for STIs before having sex. If you have an STI, let your sexual partner(s) know so you and your partner can get treatment. Otherwise, the STI can get passed to others or back to you.  Be monogamous. Having sex with only one partner can lower your risk.  Get vaccinated for HPV, current guidelines recommend HPV vaccine for male adolescents from age 11-21 and up to age 26 for men who have sex with men and immunocompromised men.  My partner has HPV, do I have it? Should I be tested?  If you have had unprotected sex with your partner you may have HPV. There is no HPV test recommended for men. HPV is a common virus and most sexually active people in the United States will have HPV at some time in their lives. There are more than 40 types of HPV that are passed on through sexual contact. Most men who get HPV never develop any symptoms or health problems. But some types of HPV can cause genital warts. Other types can cause cancers of the penis, anus or oropharynx.  Are there ways to lower my chances of getting HPV?  A safe and effective HPV vaccine (Gardasil) can protect boys and men against the HPV types that cause most genital warts and anal cancers. It is given in three shots over six months. Condoms also lower the risk of transmission, but HPV can infect areas that are not covered by a condom, so condoms may not fully protect against HPV.  What about the HPV vaccine, should I be vaccinated?  If you are 26 or younger, there is an HPV vaccine that can help protect you against the types of HPV that most commonly cause problems in men. The HPV vaccine (Gardasil) works by preventing nine HPV types, including those that cause most genital warts and those that cause cancers, including anal cancer. It protects against new HPV infections; it does not cure existing HPV infections or disease (like genital warts). It is most effective when given before a personâ€™s first sexual contact (i.e., when s/he may be exposed to HPV).  CDC recommends the HPV vaccine for all boys age 11 or 12, and for males through age 21, who have not already received all three doses. The vaccine is also recommended for gay and bisexual men, or any man who has sex with men, and men with compromised immune systems through age 26, if they did not get fully vaccinated when they are younger. The vaccine is safe for all men through age 26, but it is most effective when given at younger ages.  The HPV vaccine is very safe and effective, with no serious side effects. The most common side effect is soreness in the arm. Studies show that the vaccine can protect men against genital warts and anal cancers. It is likely that this vaccine also protects men from other HPV-related cancers, like cancers of the penis and oropharynx, but there are no vaccine studies that evaluated these outcomes.  If you have questions about the HPV vaccine, call and speak with the advice nurse at 209-228-4192. If you would like to schedule an immunization review call the appointment desk at 209-228-2273.                            University of California, Merced  5200 North Lake Rd.

While we care for all enrolled UNT students at the SHWC, we know there are special needs unique to some of our student population. We strive to meet your gynecological health care needs with a specialist dedicated to providing a confidential, caring environment. A full time gynecologist, assisted by several other medical providers, are on staff daily to address routine concerns as well as provide valuable resources for patient education on a variety of related subjects.  Gynecological services offered at the SHWC include the following:  Back to Top  Abnormal PAP Smear Consultation and Colposcopy   Colposcopy  Colposcopy (colpo) is a basic procedure to look closely at the cervix and vagina and may be recommended if you have an abnormal pap smear. Â The machine is similar to a large microscope and is used in order to see these areas at a greater magnification and look for any possible abnormalities. Â The colposcopy itself does not hurt at all â€“ it is just like a longer version of a pap smear. Â 90% of the colposcopy is spent with the gynecologist looking at areas that may be causing the abnormal cells on the pap smear. Â  If any of these areas are identified, a small biopsy may be taken and sent to pathology to determine further management. Â This may cause some minor cramping, similar to menstrual cramps, but can be eased by taking an over the counter pain reliever 30 minutes prior to the procedure.  A colposcopy can be done at the SHWC with our staff gynecologist. Â If you have had a recent abnormal pap smear and were advised to have a colpo for further evaluation, please call (940)565-2333 for a consultation with our gynecologist. Â During that visit, the entire process will be explained in detail and you will be given a chance to ask any questions before the appointment is made for the actual procedure.  Back to Top  Birth Control Options   Birth Control Pills  Birth control pills are one of the top forms of contraception that has been availableÂ in the United States since 1960. The pills taken today are much different from those first pills that came out many years ago. Today, all birth control pills are considered to be low dose â€“ this refers to the amount of estrogen each pill contains. The effective doses of estrogen range from 10mcg to 35mcg in each pill available today. Older pills contained as much as 50-75mcg of estrogen, which was responsible for increased chance of side effects during that time.  In the majority of cases, birth control pills are a combination of estrogen and progesterone. It is important that you take birth control pills every day, around the same time every day. There are alarms you can set on your phone or even apps to help you remember. When taken correctly, birth control pills have an effective rate of 99%, but it is hard to take them perfectly all the time. The typical effectiveness rate is about 92-96%. Birth control pills do not protect against STDs or HIV and consistent condom use is recommended. In addition to preventing pregnancy, birth control pills can help make periods shorter with lighter menstrual bleeding and can also significantly improve painful cramps. Birth control pills are not for everyone do to their associated risk of side effects.  If you have questions about birth control pills or contraception in general, please contact the SHWC for an appointment to speak with one of the providers about your concerns. You can call (940)565-2333 or go online to schedule an appointment.  Intrauterine Device (IUDs)  An IUD is a long acting form of birth control that has become much more popular over the last several years. Â There are currently 3 types of IUDs available in the US â€“ 2 that contain the hormone progesterone and 1 that does not contain any hormones. Â The progesterone containing IUDs are the most common: Mirena lasts for 5 years and the newer, smaller version, Skyla, for 3 years. Â Both of these are now available at the SHWC.  IUDs are very effective against preventing pregnancy â€“ greater than 99%. Â In addition to their contraceptive uses, IUDs can typically help with heavy periods and painful cramping. Â After the first few months, periods are typically several days shorter, with much lighter bleeding and decreased cramping. Â Some people donâ€™t have periods at all! Â People who have an IUD will tell you they love not having to worry about taking a pill every day or remember to get a shot every 3 months. Â It is one less thing a busy college student has to worry about.  As with any birth control, there are some risks associated with an IUD and they are not recommended for everyone. Â One common misconception is that you have to have had a child before you can get an IUD. Â This used to be a recommendation but is no longer valid. Â In fact, younger individuals who have not had children are the specific group the manufacturers of the newer IUD, Skyla, had in mind when coming up with this product. Â As with any method of birth control, IUDs do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases and consistent condom use is always recommended.  If you are interested in learning more about IUDs and if they would be a reasonable option for you, please call (940) 565-2333 to schedule a consultation with the gynecologist.  Nexplanon  Nexplanon is a long acting contraceptive implant that provides birth control for 3 years. Â The device is a small, flexible plastic rod that contains the hormone progesterone and is inserted under the skin of the upper arm. It is easily inserted at an office visit and numbing medicine is used beforehand so it is quick and painless. Â The implant can be felt under the skin but not seen so it is very discreet.  It is one of the most effective types of birth control available and has a pregnancy prevention rate greater than 99%. Â Many people prefer Nexplanon over other forms of birth control, like the pill, because they do not have to remember to take it at the same time every day and they donâ€™t have to think about birth control for the next 3 years. Â Like other forms of birth control, Nexplanon does not prevent against any sexually transmitted diseases and consistent condom use is recommended. Â Also, as with any form of birth control, there can be risks associated with Nexplanon as well as possible side effects.  If you have questions about Nexplanon or contraception in general, please contact the SHWC for an appointment to speak with the staff gynecologist. Â You can call (940)565-2333 or go online at www.myosh.unt.edu to schedule an appointment.  For questions regarding Plan B contact the UNT Pharmacy .  Back to Top  Painful Periods(Cramps)   Menstrual cramps are one of the most common complaintsÂ when it comes to issues with periods. Painful menstrual cramping, also known as dysmenorrhea, affects a majority of reproductive age individuals at some point in their lives, with as many as 90% of teenagers affected. Symptoms can gradually worsen over the years until the pain becomes so severe they miss work or school 1 or more days each month.  Menstrual cramps typically begin prior to the onset of bleeding and can last for 1-2 days of the cycle. Patients often experience pain in their lower back and thighs. Other symptoms that can be associated with the onset of bleeding are headaches, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and occasionally diarrhea. In a majority of cases, dysmenorrhea is due to natural chemicals called prostaglandins produced in the body that are released in menstrual blood. These substances cause increased uterine contractions and pain. In a majority of cases, cramps can be controlled by taking NSAIDs (Advil, ibuprofen, Aleve, etc.) during the first few days of the period. Another great option that helps control the pain caused by periods as some of the other symptoms listed above are birth control pills. Not only does the pill prevent pregnancy, it can make periods much more tolerable.  If you suffer from painful periods, please contact the SHWC for an appointment to speak with one our medical providers about your concerns. You can call (940) 565-2333 or go online to schedule an appointment.  Back to Top  Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Testing, Counseling, and Treatment   Genital Herpes (HSV)  One of the most common STDs is genital herpes, with more than 750,000 new infections each year. It is caused by an infection with the herpes virus (HSV), of which there are 2 types: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Oral lesions associated with HSV-1 are also known as â€œcold soresâ€ or â€œfever blistersâ€ but can be present in the genital region as well. Typically, HSV-2 only infects the genitals. Once you have been exposed to the virus, it stays with you for the rest of your life, but that does not mean you will have symptoms forever, as the disease usually becomes milder over a period of years.  HSV is passed between partners through vaginal, oral, and anal intercourse as well as direct skin to skin contact. HSV infections are characterized by multiple blisters on the penis or vulva that eventually break open to form shallow, painful ulcers. These ulcers eventually heal completely in a few weeks, leaving no evidence of any disease. This is an example of an â€œoutbreak.â€ If you have sores, cuts, or areas of irritation that tend to reappear, this may be recurring outbreaks and it is important to come in and be evaluated. Even though the virus is always present in the body, there are medications available to help prevent outbreaks and/or make them shorter, milder and reduce the risk of transmission of the disease to others.  Many people with herpes infections may not experience an outbreak and never know they have the disease, thereby unknowingly transmitting it to others. The virus may also be passed between partners when no active sores are present in a phenomenon known as asymptomatic viral shedding. It is impossible to know how you will react to an infection with HSV â€“ some will never even know they have the disease, others may have only a few outbreaks in their lifetime, and some will have issues with recurrent outbreaks several times per year. It is important to avoid any sexual activity if any suspicious lesions are present and condoms are a crucial way to help prevent the spread of the disease.  If you have questions about herpes or are worried about a possible infection, please contact the SHWC for an appointment to speak with one of the providers about your concerns. You can call (940) 565-2333 or go online to schedule an appointment.  Genital Warts  Another very common STD is genital warts. Â Genital warts are caused by an infection with human papilloma virus (HPV). Â Over 100 different types of HPV have been identified with more than 40 infecting the genital tract alone. Â In many cases, these infections often go undetected unless a person has an abnormal pap smear or a person develops genital warts that can be seen.  In the majority of cases of genital HPV infections, the warts are asymptomatic (do not cause any problems) but can be very bothersome to patients emotionally as well as cosmetically. Â The lesions are usually flesh colored growths of varying sizes that can be flat or elevated. Â It is common to have several groups or clusters of warts on the penisÂ orÂ labia or at the opening of the vagina. Â If the warts grow large enough, they can be itchy or painful depending on their location. Â Warts can be treated several different ways, many of which are provided at the SHWC. Â Your provider can help you decide which method may be the best option for you. Â There is also a vaccine (Gardasil) availableÂ which is effective against 2 types of HPV which cause 90% of genital warts. Â This is a series of 3 injections, which is also available at the SHWC.  If you have questions about genital warts, HPV infections, or the Gardasil vaccine, please contact the SHWC for an appointment to speak with one of the providers about your concerns. Â You can call (940) 565-2333 or go online at www.myosh.unt.edu to schedule an appointment.  Back to Top  Urinary Tract Infections   Urinary tract complaints are a very common reasonÂ to seek care with their medical provider. It is much more common for individuals with vaginas to get a urinary tract infection (UTI or bladder infection) based simply on their anatomy. The urethra (the tube that connects the bladder to the outside of our body) is much shorter and therefore more susceptible to becoming infected with bacteria that are normally found in the genital region.  Symptoms of a UTI include: frequency of urination, pain or burning during or at the end of urination, pelvic pain, back or side pain, and blood in the urine. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. A patient can develop fever and chills as well as nausea and/or vomiting in a severe infection. If left untreated, UTIs can turn into severe kidney infections which may require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. It is important to seek medical care if you think you might have a UTI. When you make an appointment at the SHWC, a urine sample is collected and tested while you wait to see if an infection is present. If so, a short course of antibiotics will be prescribed. The symptoms typically resolve in a few days with medical treatment.  The likelihood of getting a UTI increases with sexual activity, therefore it is important to remember to empty your bladder immediately after intercourse. Also, always practice good hygiene. Drinking plenty of fluids can help flush the bladder as well. These are just a few of the ways to help prevent a UTI from developing.  Back to Top  Vaginal Infections   Bacterial Vaginosis  Most peopleof reproductive age will have symptoms of increased vaginal discharge, odor, and itching/irritation at some point. These symptoms are consistent with a vaginal infection. Typically, patients will assume they have a yeast infection and treat with an over the counter medication. This may be the case, but a more common vaginal infection is bacterial vaginosis (BV). These infections can be very similar to one another and difficult to tell apart, especially if you have never had something similar before.  BV is characterized by a thin, clear or whitish vaginal discharge and usually, an odor is present. Irritation and itching can occur, although in most cases, it is milder than what patients experience with yeast infections. BV is not considered a sexually transmitted disease. A simple test called a wet prep can be done at the SHWC to tell what type of infection is present. The results are ready in about 15 minutes. If the test confirms bacterial vaginosis, a prescription will be written for antibiotics. It will usually resolve with medication in about a week.  If you think you might have a vaginal infection, please contact the SHWC for an appointment to speak with one of the providers about your concerns. You can call (940) 565-2333 or go online to schedule an appointment.  Yeast Infections  Yeast infections are common and most peopleÂ will get a yeast infection at least once in their lifetime. Some individualswill have infections occurring more frequently â€“ up to several times per year. Typical symptoms of a yeast infection are fairly well recognizedÂ and include thick, white vaginal discharge and itching. The skin in the genital region may be red and swollen or irritated. Sometimes, symptoms may be more subtle and harder for a patient to figure out what is going on. For example, there may be itching or irritation only and no discharge. Many vaginal infections can present in the same way, making self-diagnosis more difficult.  With a pelvic examination and testing done at the time of an appointment at the SHWC, a yeast infection can be easily diagnosed. Patients have a variety of treatment options, including a one-time dose of oral medication or traditional vaginal preparations that can be purchased over the counter. Symptoms usually resolve quickly with either type of medication.  If you think you might have a vaginal infection, please contact the SHWC for an appointment to speak with one of the providers about your concerns. You can call (940) 565-2333 or go online to schedule an appointment.

We refer to these methods as birth control options ( BCOs ). There are many different options available and everyone has a different preference based on price, use, hormones, etc. Choosing the right birth control option can be overwhelming. If youâ€™d like to discuss your birth control options, call Bronco Wellness Center (909) 869-5272 to make an appointment with a Health Educator.

These methods track your menstrual cycle so it is known when the ovaries release an egg every month. Days near ovulation are considered fertile days and sex should be avoided during these days. Birth control methods (like condoms) can also be used on these days to prevent pregnancy. Here are a few different ways to track your fertility:  The Temperature Method : you take your temperature in the morning every day before you get out of bed.  The Cervical Mucus Method : you check your cervical mucus (vaginal discharge) every day.  The Calendar Method : you chart your menstrual cycle on a calendar.    Effectiveness at Preventing Pregnancy: 76-88%  Does not protect against STIs  Use daily  Can cost $0 to $20  Advantages:  Requires no drugs or devices, but does require abstaining from sex during the entire first cycle to chart mucus characteristics  Inexpensive  May be acceptable to members of religious groups    Disadvantages  Calendar: Requires good record keeping before and during use of method  Mucus: Restricts sexual spontaneity during fertile period  Requires extended periods of abstinence  Unpredictability of cycle           Withdrawal (Pull Out Method)        Withdrawal is pulling the penis out of the vagina before ejaculation. Ejaculating away from the vulva or vagina prevents pregnancy. It is essential to pull out before any semen comes out, every single intercourse for this method to be effective.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NIPSVS), about 20% of women and 2% of men have been raped;Â and approximately 44% of women and 23% of men have been the victim of sexual violence other than rape. In relation to sexual orientation, 1 in 2 bisexual women, 1 in 8 lesbian women, and 1 in 6 heterosexual women have been raped. Among men, 2 out of 5 gay men, 1 of every 2 bisexual men, and 1 of every 5 heterosexual men have been subjected to sexual violence other than rape. According to FORGE, approximately 50% of transgendered individuals have been sexually violated.  That said, federal and state laws and CSU/Cal State LA policies prohibit sexual violence, as well as dating and domestic violence, stalking, and other forms of misconduct. This prohibition applies to students, employees, and others; as well as to conduct both on and off-campus. Perpetrators can be subject to campus sanctions such as suspension, expulsion, and employment termination; as well as arrest, criminal prosecution, restitution, and civil justice. Victims and survivors have numerous rights granted by federal and state lawsÂ (see Survivors' Rights ).Â Additionally, sexual violence is also considered to be a Title IX violation.   Sexual Violence Overview  What is sexual violence? Sexual violence encompasses a variety of behaviors that involve nonconsensual sexual conduct. Sexual violence may include:  Examples from the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey   Being made to penetrate someone else   This may be accomplished through physical force (e.g., being pinned or held down, use of violence), using threats of physical harm, or occur when a victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent. Examples of being made to penetrate someone else include:   Being made to orally penetrate another personâ€™s vagina or anus.    Being made to: penetrate someone's vagina or anus using oneâ€™s own penis; orally penetrate someone's vagina or anus; receive oral sex.    It also includes attempts make someone penetrate someone else.      Non-contact unwanted sexual experiences   Non-contact unwanted sexual experiences don't involve touching or penetration. They include someone:   Exposing their genitals or other sexual body parts, flashing, or masturbating in front of the victim.    Making a victim show their genitals or breasts.    Making a victim look at or participate in sexual photos or movies.    Harassing a victim in a public place in a way that made the victim feel unsafe.      Rape   Completed or attempted unwanted vaginal, oral, or anal penetration through the use of physical force (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threats to physically harm and includes times when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent. The survey categoriezes rape in three ways, completed forced penetration, attempted forced penetration, and completed alcohol or drug facilitated penetration. Rape includes:   Vaginal, oral, or anal penetration by a penis. It also includes vaginal or anal penetration by someone using their fingers or an object.      Sexual coercion   In the survey, sexual coercion refers to unwanted vaginal, oral, or anal sex after being pressured in ways that included being worn down by someone who repeatedly asked for sex or showed they were unhappy; feeling pressured by being lied to, being told promises that were untrue, having someone threaten to end a relationship or spread rumors; and sexual pressure due to someone using their influence or authority.     Unwanted sexual contact   The survey defines unwanted sexual contact as unwanted sexual experiences involving touch but not sexual penetration, such as being kissed in a sexual way, or having sexual body parts fondled or grabbed.    Examples from the National Domestic Violence Hotline   Sexually abusive methods of retaining power and control include an abusive partner:  Forcing you to dress in a sexual way  Insulting you in sexual ways or calls you sexual names  Forcing or manipulating you into having sex or performing sexual acts  Holding you down during sex  Demanding sex when you're sick, tired or after hurting you  Hurting you with weapons or objects during sex  Involving other people in sexual activities with you against your will  Ignoring your feelings regarding sex  Forcing you to watch pornography  Purposefully trying to pass on a sexually transmitted disease to you    Sexual coercion  Sexual coercion lies on the 'continuum' of sexually aggressive behavior. It can vary from being egged on and persuaded, to being forced to have contact. It can be verbal and emotional, in the form of statements that make you feel pressure, guilt, or shaame. You can also be made to feel forced through more subtle actions. For example, an abusive partner: Making you feel like you owe them - For example, because you're in a relationship, because you've had sex before, because they spent money on you or bought you a gift  Giving you drugs and alcohol to ""loosen up"" your inhibitions  Playing on the fact that you're in a relationship, saying things such as: ""Sex is the way to prove your love for me,"" ""If I don't get sex from you I'll get it somewhere else""  Reacting negatively with sadness, anger or resentment if you say no or don't immediately agree to something  Continuing to pressure you after you say no  Making you feel threatened or afraid of what might happen if you say no  Trying to normalize their sexual expections, for example ""I need it, I'm a man""    Even if your partner isn't forcing you to do sexual acts against your will, being made to feel obligated is coercion in itself. Dating someone, being in a relationship, or being married never means that you owe your partner intimacy of any kind.    Reproductive coercion  Reproductive coercion is a form of power and control where one partner strips the other of the ability to control their own reproductive system. It is sometimes difficult to identify this coercion because other forms of abuse are often occuring simultaneously.  Reproductive coercion can be exerted in many ways: Refusing to use a condom or other type of birth control  Breaking or removing a condom during intercourse  Lying about their methods of birth control (for example, lying about having a vasectomy, lying about being on the pill)  Refusing to ""pull out"" if that is the agreed upon method of birth control  Forcing you to not use any birth control (for example, the pill, condom, shot, ring, etc.)  Removing birth control methods (for example, rings, IUDs, contraceptive patches)  Sabotaging irth control methods (for example, poking holes in condoms, tampering with pills or flushing them down the toilet)  Withholding finances needed to purchase birth control  Monitoring your menstrual cycles  Forcing pregnancy and not supporting your decision about when or if you want to have a child  Forcing you to get an abortion, or preventing you from getting one  Threatening you or acting violent if you don't comply with their wishes to either end or continue a pregnancy  Continually keeping you pregnant (getting you pregnant again shortly after you give birth)    Consent Considerations  Consent as Defined by the California Penal Code  California Penal Code Â§261.6 states consent is â€œpositive cooperation in act or attitude pursuant to an exercise of free will. The person must act freely and voluntarily and have knowledge of the nature of the act or transaction involved. A current or previous dating or marital relationship shall not be sufficient to constitute consent where consent is at issue in a prosecution.â€ Per California Penal Code Â§261.7 , a request by a victim for a sexual violence perpetrator to â€œuse a condom or other birth control device, without additional evidence of consent, is not sufficient to constitute consent.â€  Consent as Defined by the California Education Code  California Education Code Â§67386 establishes an affirmative consent standard. This is the basis by which campus complaints are decided. ""'Affirmative consent' means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that he or she has the affirmative consent of the other or others to engage in the sexual activity. Lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent, nor does silence mean consent. Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time. The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent...""  So, keep these important facts in mind when considering consent  The key to preventing sexual violence and misconduct is to obtain valid consent for all sexual activity â€” from kissing or touching someone on the butt, to oral, vaginal or anal penetration. If consent has not been given or has been withdrawn, sexual activity must be stopped immediately. Important factors to consider about consent include:    It is the responsibility of every individual involved in a sex act to obtain clear, ongoing, affirmative consent - even when under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.    Individuals under the age of 18 cannot give legal consent.    Consent is based on personal choice and requires active participation in decision-making.    Consent is not valid if given as a result of fear, coercion, force, violence, threat of violence or retribution.    The absence of a â€œyesâ€ means â€œno.â€    A request for condom or birth control use does not, in and of itself, constitute consent.    Relationship status, being ""in love,"" previous sexual intimacy with a person, spending money on someone, helping a classmate with a project, or any other circumstance does not obligate anyone to be sexually intimate with someone else if the person does not want to be; nor do these or any other factors entitle anyone to sex.      California law allows consent to be withdrawn at any time - including after penetration.    Silence and lack of protest or resistance do not mean consent has been given.   An incapacitated person cannot give consent. Examples of incapacitation include when an individual: Is asleep.  Is unconscious, coming in and out of consciousness, or blacked out.  Is under the influence of alcohol, drugs, medications, or other substances to the point where their judgment and decision-making abilities are impaired and the person does not fully understand the sexual activity.   Has a mental or physical condition or disability that prevents giving consent.     Consent for one act (e.g., intimate touching, oral sex) does not establish consent for other acts (e.g., vaginal sex, anal sex).    So, in a nutshell, only ""Yes"" means ""Yes.""   ""Yes Means Yes"" California Version    Video of &amp;quot;Yes Means Yes&amp;quot; California Version      Criminal Sexual Conduct   Sexual Contact   Assault with intent to commit rape, sodomy, oral copulation ( Â§220 )...    Oral copulation ( Â§288a ): Oral-genital or oral-anal contact.    Rape ( Â§261 ): Sexual intercourse with someone who is not the spouse of the perpetrator. Any sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the crime of rape.    Sexual battery ( Â§243.4 ): Touching an intimate part (e.g., genitals, anus, groin, or buttocks of anyone; breast of a female).    Sexual penetration with a foreign object ( Â§289 ): Penetration, however slight, of the genital or anal opening of any person or causing someone else to penetrate the perpetrator or another person with any foreign object (including body parts other than a penis), substance, instrument, device, or unknown object.    Sodomy ( Â§286 ): Contact between the penis of one person and the anus of another person. Any sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the crime of sodomy.    Spousal rape ( Â§262 ): Sexual intercourse with the spouse of the perpetrator. Any sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the crime.    Unlawful sexual intercourse ( Â§261.5 ): Sexual intercourse with someone who is a minor (less than 18 years of age) and not the perpetratorâ€™s spouse.     Without Consent   When a person is incapable of giving legal consent.    Against a personâ€™s will with the use of force, violence, coercion, threats, or fear of immediate injury on the victim or another person.    With someone who is younger than 18 years of age.    When the person is incapable of giving legal consent because of a mental disorder or developmental or physical disability.    When a person is prevented from resisting by an intoxicating or other substance (e.g., alcohol).    Where a person was unconscious or asleep or not aware of the act.    When a person is illegally restrained.    Against the victimâ€™s will by threatening to retaliate in the future against the victim or any other person.    When deceit is used to make a victim believe the sexual contact is being done by someone other than the person doing it.    Against the personâ€™s will by threatening to use the authority of a public official.    While voluntarily helping another person to perpetrate the crime.    Causing another person to commit these crimes.    Note: The above list does not include all forms of criminal sexual conduct (e.g., indecent exposure).  Sexual Misconduct and Consent as Defined by CSU Policies  CSU Executive Order 1096 | Â  Â Â CSU Executive Order 1097   Sexual Misconduct. All sexual activity between members of the CSU community must be based on Affirmative Consent. Engaging in any sexual activity without first obtaining Affirmative Consent to the specific activity constitutes Sexual Misconduct and is a violation of this policy, whether or not the conduct violates any civil or criminal law.  Sexual Misconduct is a form of Sexual Harassment and may create a sexually hostile environment that affects access to or participation in CSU programs and activities. CSU prohibits all such conduct whether or not it also amounts to Sexual Harassment.  Sexual activity includes but is not limited to kissing, touching intimate body parts, fondling, intercourse, penetration of any body part, and oral sex.  Affirmative Consent means an informed, affirmative, conscious, voluntary, and mutual agreement to engage in sexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that s/he has the Affirmative Consent of the other participant(s) to engage in the sexual activity. Lack of protest or resistance does not mean Affirmative Consent, nor does silence mean Affirmative Consent. Affirmative Consent must be voluntary, and given without coercion, force, threats or intimidation.  The existence of a dating or social relationship between those involved, or the fact of past sexual activities between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of Affirmative Consent. A request for someone to use a condom or birth control does not, in and of itself, constitute Affirmative Consent.  Affirmative Consent can be withdrawn or revoked. Consent to one form of sexual activity (or one sexual act) does not constitute consent to other forms of sexual activity. Consent given to sexual activity on one occasion does not constitute consent on another occasion. There must always be mutual and affirmative consent to engage in sexual activity. Consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time, including after penetration. Once consent is withdrawn or revoked, the sexual activity must stop immediately.  Affirmative Consent cannot be given by a person who is incapacitated. A person is unable to consent when s/he is asleep, unconscious or is incapacitated due to the influence of drugs, alcohol or medication so that s/he could not understand the fact, nature or extent of the sexual activity.Â  A person is incapacitated if s/he lacks the physical and/or mental ability to make informed, rational decisions.  Whether an intoxicated person (as a result of using alcohol or other drugs) is incapacitated depends on the extent to which the alcohol or other drugs impact the personâ€™s decision-making ability, awareness of consequences, and ability to make informed judgments. A personâ€™s own intoxication or incapacitation from drugs or alcohol does not diminish that personâ€™s responsibility to obtain Affirmative Consent before engaging in sexual activity.  A person with a medical or mental disability may also lack the capacity to give consent.  Sexual activity with a minor (a person under 18 years old) is not consensual, because a minor is considered incapable of giving consent due to age.  It shall not be a valid excuse that a person affirmatively consented to the sexual activity if the Respondent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was unable to consent to the sexual activity under any of the following circumstances:  The person was asleep or unconscious;  The person was incapacitated due to the influence of drugs, alcohol or medication, so that the person could not understand the fact, nature or extent of the sexual activity;  The person was unable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition.  It shall not be a valid excuse that the Respondent believed that the person consented to the sexual activity under either of the following circumstances:  The Respondentâ€™s belief in Affirmative Consent arose from the intoxication or recklessness of the Respondent;  The Respondent did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the Respondent at the time, to ascertain whether the person affirmatively consented.  Sexual Harassment and Title IX  Title IX of the Education amendments of 1972 prohibits denying or limiting, on the basis of sex, a student's ability to participate in or to receive benefits, services, or opportunities in a school's programs. Title IX protects all studentsÂ â€” female, male, transgendered, gender non-conforming, gay, lesbian, bisexual...Â â€” in all of the academic, educational, extracurricular, athletic, and other programs or activities of schools. Title IX also prohibits and requires protection against retaliation.  Title IX violations occur when conduct is ""sufficiently serious to deny or limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the program""Â  â€” e.g., anxiety or depression; dropping out of a student organization, leaving a team, or declining class participation in an effort to avoid harassment. Sexual harassment and gender-based harassment are well-known forms of Title IX violations:  Sexual harassment: Unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment can include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Decisions or benefits based on submission to unwelcome sexual conduct â€” e.g., course grade, position on a team, membership in an organization, and a positive performance appraisal.  Hostile environment â€” e.g., sexual gestures, sexual jokes, name calling, showing sexual images or content, spreading sexual rumors.   Gender-based harassment: Acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, even if those acts do not involve conduct of a sexual nature. E.g., harassing, threatening or assaulting a student because she or he isn't ""woman"" or ""man"" enough.   Domestic and Sexual Violence | Stalking: Title IX violations also encompass dating and domestic violence, sexual violence, and sexually motivated stalking. In its guidance document Sexual Harassment: It's Not Academic , the U.S. Department of Education states â€” ""Sexual harassment includes conduct that is criminal in nature, such as rape, sexual assault, dating violence, and sexually motivated stalking. Even if a school reports possible criminal conduct to the police, that does not relieve the school of its responsibilities under Title IX...""

Procedures Performed by Health Services Providers:   Annual Exams  Pap Smears  Contraceptive Management  Pregnancy Testing  IUD Insertion and Removal â€“ Click here for more information  Nexplanon Insertion and Removal â€“ Click here for more information  Sexually Transmitted Infection Testing (STI Testing)  Depo-Provera Injections  Other Gynecological concerns   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recently came out with new Pap smear guidelines:   Women should have their first screening Pap smear at age 21 unless the women has had a previous abnormal Pap smear.  Women in their 20â€™s should have a Pap smear every three years (assuming prior Pap smears have been normal).  Women age 30 and older who have had three consecutive normal Pap smears should have a Pap smear every three years.  Women who have had a hysterectomy for non-cancerous reasons do not need a Pap smear unless they have a cervix.  These guidelines need to be followed whether you have or have not had the HPV vaccine.  Georgia Southern Health Services response to the new recommendations:  We still recommend a yearly physical including a breast exam, pelvic exam*, and STI screening if indicated.  If you have ever had an abnormal Pap smear, consult with your Health Services physician or nurse practitionerÂ concerning how often you will need a Pap smear.   *The pelvic exam may or may not include a Pap smear based on your history and the ACOG guidelines. Your physician or nurseÂ practitioner will discuss this with you at the time of your appointment.  Information Regarding an Appointment in the Womenâ€™s Health Clinic   A vaginal exam, if indicated, may not be performed if you are on your menstrual cycle. If you are on your menstrual cycle, your appointment may be rescheduled.  You may be asked to submit a urine specimen at your examination visit for evaluation of specific symptoms.  Drinking water will keep you hydrated. Staying hydrated will make it easier for the lab personnel to access a vein if it is necessary to draw your blood for testing.  Do NOT use any vaginal creams or douche for two (2) days prior to your examination because it will interfere with your test results if a vaginal exam is indicated.  Do NOT have sexual intercourse for two (2) days prior to your examination because it will interfere with your test results if a vaginal exam is indicated.  Write down any questions you may have so you can discuss them with your provider at the time of your examination.    Prescription Refill requests:  In order to serve you more efficiently, if you require a refill on a medication prescribed for you by one of our providers, please contact the pharmacy where you filled the script to initiate the refill request electronically; or, you may send your provider a secure message in Online Student Health to request the refill.Â  Health Services providers do not accept telephoned refill requests.

It is up to the student to submit all receipts to their insurance provider for reimbursement. Employees should see their primary care provider off campus.  Services include treatment for minor acute illnesses and injuries, annual women health exams, birth control, allergy injections and required immunizations. Physical examinations are provided for all UIS athletes and for students who are required to have them for work, school, etc.  A wellness resource and self-help area is available in the Health Services (HS) clinic and a supply of over-the-counter remedies is also available along with guidelines and directions for their use.  The HS is supported by student fees (shared with the UIS Counseling Center) university funds and some user fees. There is no charge for visits to the HS although there are some charges for special services. Students are notified at the time of the visit if any charges will be incurred. It is the students responsibility to submit paid receipts for reimbursement to their insurance provider. Because more complex health issues sometimes arise, students are expected to have their own health insurance to cover those types of expenses. Students are responsible for informing the HS staff if their insurance requires the use of specific providers.  Patient Health Record  We require anyone who receives service or consultation in the Health Services to complete a Medical History form PDF prior to their clinic visit. We ask that you review the information at each visit to the Health Service so that your information remains current throughout your academic career at UIS Copies of the form can be found online at:  All completed Medical History form PDF are reviewed by a Health Care Provider for immunization compliance with state and federal regulations, and for any medications, allergies, chronic diseases and other health issues so that we may provide the appropriate services. This review takes place before the provider examines the student and prior to each visit.  Services offered by the HS are a valuable resource to the campus and are free or low cost in most instances. When an appointment is not cancelled in a timely fashion, it may cause a serious inconvenience to others who need health care, who are ill or injured and need to be seen as soon as any appointment is available. The no-show fee encourages students to be timely in canceling their appointments and helps to finance the cost of health care provider time that was not utilized because an appointment was not cancelled in a timely fashion.  University Of Illinois Nondiscrimination Statement:  The commitment of the University of Illinois to the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equality of opportunity, and human dignity requires that decisions involving students and employees be based on individual merit and be free from invidious discrimination in all its forms.  The University of Illinois will not engage in discrimination or harassment against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, disability, sexual orientation, unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran and will comply with all federal and state nondiscrimination, equal opportunity and affirmative action laws, orders and regulations. This nondiscrimination policy applies to admissions, employment, access to and treatment in the University programs and activities.  University complaint and grievance procedures provide employees and students with the means for the resolution of complaints that allege a violation of this Statement.  Student/Staff Eligibility   Who is eligible to use Health Services?   The HS provides treatment to all students, full- or part-time, whether or not they have student insurance. Employees should see their primary care providers.   Is there a cost to use Health Services?   Students do not pay an office visit fee. Some small user fees are charged for certain services.  Policy for appointments missed without notice  A â€œno-showâ€ fee of $15.00 is charged to those who do not show up for appointments and for those who cancel appointments less than 24 hours before the appointment time.   Clinical services available  Services provided include treatment for minor illnesses such as colds, allergies, infections, examinations such as annual women health exams, pelvic exams, and minor injuries. Hypertension and diabetic monitoring are also available. For more complicated illnesses, referrals are made to other physicians and agencies through HS.  Students with the UIS Student Insurance  (Academic HealthPlans / Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illiniois) can call an after hours nurse at 1-800-299-0274 with any medical questions or concerns.  back to top   Over the counter remedies & equipment for loan     Antacids  Cold tablets  Decongestants    Aspirin  Condoms (click here to request some for a project)  Ice bags    Band Aids  Crutches (loan)  Lozenges      Costs to students  Any charges will post to your student account as â€œHealth Serviceâ€  For your Health Care needs, services are but not limited to:     Procedure / Vaccination  Students    Allergy Shots â€“ per semester (orders from allergist required)   $40.00    Birth Control Pill  FREE upon availability     Blood Glucose  $5.00    Chlamydia screening  $25.00    Depo-Provera (birth control shot)  $160.00    Flu Vaccine   FREE  â€“ students & employees/retirees  with State Benefits/proof of UIN or State ID & State Insurance Card     Gonorrhea screening  $25.00    Gonorrhea Treatment  $8.00    Hepatitis B Vaccine â€“ 3 injections @ $70ea  $70.00    HIV screening   $20.00    HPV (Gardasil) Vaccine â€“ 3 injections @ $175ea  $175.00    MMR Vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella)  $80.00    Meningococcal/Meningitis Vaccine  $115.00    Nebulizer Treatment-Includes Supplies  $20.00    Nebulizer Treatment-Meds only  $12.00    Peak Flow Meter  $25.00    Plan B   $20.00    QFG â€“ Quantiferon Gold (TB blood test)  $40.00    Rapid Strep Test  $8.00    Syphilis / RPR screening  $15.00    TB Skin Test  $10.00    TD Vaccine  $30.00    Tdap (Adult-tetanus diphtheria acellular pertussis/whooping cough)  $40.00    Urine Dip  $3.00    Urine Pregnancy Test-here  $6.00    Wart Treatment  $20.00    Womenâ€™s Health Exam  FREE    PAP Smear  $30.00     More vaccines/services are available that are not listed.

Before You Visit  You should not be menstruating on the day of yourÂ exam and should call 301-314-8190 to reschedule your appointment.  Know the date of the first day of your last menstrual period.  Avoid penetrative sexual intercourse, tampons, douching, & vaginal medications for at leastÂ 2 daysÂ prior to your visit.  We encourage you to read this Patient Guide to Sensitive Health Exams to help you understand standard of care protocols during sensitive health exams Â (breast, genital, or rectal).         Services      Annual Gynecological Exams    The annual gynecological exam includes a routine breast and pelvic exam, chlamydia and gonorrhea testing.Â  A Pap test may also be recommended depending on your age and sexual history.Â  We recommend women start Pap testing at age 21.Â  All women of any age who areÂ sexually activeÂ need a check up and screening for STI's at minimum once a year.       Breast Health    Many college-aged students are unaware of the possibility of developing breast cancer as a young adult.Â  Many changes occur in your breasts during your lifetime so it is important to understand which changes are normal and which are not. Also, some of us may be at a higher risk for developing breast cancer. We encourage you to become familiar with your breasts, know what is normal for you, and learn how to spot changes in your breasts.  Many factors are linked to breast cancer risk. Some risk factors (such as drinking alcohol) can be avoided. But most risk factors (such as having a family history of breast cancer) can't be avoided. Having a risk factorâ€”or even severalâ€”doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™ll definitely get a diseaseâ€”it just increases your chances. Understanding which factors may affect your risk can help you and your health care provider develop a breast health plan that is right for you. This website will help you to better understand your risk - identifying your risk-factor .      Colposcopy    Colposcopy is a procedure used to evaluate a woman's cervix when her Pap test result is abnormal and further testing is needed to obtain a diagnosis. Please read this Colposcopy Fact Sheet for more information. Colposcopy services are available in the Women's Health department by appointment. If a provider has referred you for a colposcopy, an appointment can be made by calling 301-314-8190.      Contraception (birth control) & Emergency Contraception       â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ In Women's Health, students can obtain prescriptions for oral contraceptives (birth control pills), the vaginal ring (NuvaRing), the contraceptive patch, diaphragms, the shot (Depo Provera), as well as insertions for implants (Nexplanon) and IUDs. Diaphragm checks and instructions on other forms of birth control are offered as well.  The emergency contraceptive pill (ECP) Plan B One Step and Ella are available at the health center. Plan B One Step is over the counter at our Pharmacy and Ella requires an office visit and prescription.       Pregnancy Testing & Counseling    Pregnancy is a big event in a woman's life, and it's normal to have many questions about it. Some people have basic questions about how pregnancy happens. Others may have questions about avoiding pregnancy while some are considering pregnancy and seeking pre-pregnancy health information. Some people may be looking for options regarding an unintended pregnancy.  You may schedule an appointment to have a blood or urine pregnancy test performed by calling 301-314-8190.Â  You will be given an appointment with a provider who will give you your results, referrals, and information about available support services. You may also visit the Health Center Pharmacy to purchase an over-the-counter urine home pregnancy test.      Sexually Transmitted Infection Testing    Women's Health routinely screens and treats Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), including:  Chlamydia  Gonorrhea  Herpes  HPV (Genital Warts)  Syphilis  Hepatitis B & C  HIV   Visit our sexual health page to learn about "" What You Should Expect and What You Should Know Before Getting Tested for STIs"" and for a more comprehensive list of free and low-cost testing options at University Health Center.

Men's Health  Itâ€™s our goal to heighten awareness of preventable health problems and encourage early detection and treatment of disease among men.  On average, men die at a significantly younger age than women; the average life expectancy for men is almost five years shorter than it is for women.  In comparison with women, men are often more likely to:   Lack the information and understanding about health issues specific to men.  Engage in unhealthy and risky activities that threaten their health (for example, men are more likely to smoke and drink than women).  Put off regular health checkups and medical care when needed.  Avoid openly discussing their health and how theyâ€™re feeling.   The primary reason for the poor state of menâ€™s health is that men need to pay more attention to their health.  At UMKC Student Health and Wellness, we provide a multitude of services to keep men healthy.   General health care and routine physical exams.  Support in modifying risk behaviors that negative affect your health.  Screening for and the management of sexually transmitted infections (STIâ€™s).  Birth control and safer sex education â€” we provide condoms!  Diagnosis and treatment of male genital problems: pain, rashes, lumps, etc.  Evaluation of sexual concerns and reproductive health needs, such as premature ejaculation.  Cancer prevention and screening:  Testicular exams â€” young men are a higher risk for testicular cancer than older men.  Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine information and immunization.    Urinary tract infection (UTI) testing and treatment  Male pattern baldness information and treatment   Sexual Consent  It is important for every person to understand sexual consent and impairment.  Consent is positive cooperation involving an act of free will, absent of coercion, intimidation, force, or the threat of force. A person cannot give effective consent if they are impaired by the influence of drugs or alcohol.   Women's Health  Every woman deserves to thrive and be empowered. Womenâ€™s Health is strongly supported at UMKC Student Health and Wellness. Our goal is to provide comfortable, open communication to address your specific concerns. Women have unique health issues related to contraception, menstrual cycle, conditions of the female organs, and menopause.  Student Health and Wellness offers many womenâ€™s health services. Below are some examples of these services and the fees that apply. Contact our office to inquire about any services not listed below. Fees are subject to change without notification.  Well-Woman Exams  Routine female exams (pap/pelvic and breast exam) can be scheduled by making an appointment. Student Health and WellnessÂ offers the liquid-based Pap test. If the Pap test is abnormal, further testing for Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) can be conducted and follow-up will depend on those results.  Evaluation and Information Regarding Vaginal Discharge  All women have some vaginal discharge. Normal discharge may appear clear, cloudy white, and/or yellowish when dry on clothing. It may also contain white flecks and at times may be thin and stringy. Changes in normal discharge can occur for many reasons, including menstrual cycle, emotional stressors, nutritional status, pregnancy, usage of medications â€“ including birth control pills â€“ and sexual arousal.   A vaginal yeast infection produces a thick white discharge, similar to cottage cheese in texture, which can cause itching. There is no charge for this test.  Bacterial Vaginosis is an overgrowth of vaginal bacteria and produces a thin, white discharge, often with a fishy odor. There is no charge for this test.  Trichomonas Vaginalis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a protozoa that produces a white to green discharge with a fishy odor. There is a test to assist with diagnosisÂ that has aÂ fee.  Vaginal discharge can also be caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia, which are sexually transmitted infections. There is a fee for this test.   Call or make an appointment to further discuss being evaluated for any of these infections.  Birth Control Counseling and Information  Birth control counseling is available by scheduling a Nurse Practitioner visit. Contraception options that can be prescribed at Student Health and Wellness include birth control pills, Depo-Provera (the shot), NuvaRing (vaginal ring), Ortho Evra (the patch), and Intrauterine Devices (IUDs).Â Referrals can be given forÂ implantations (Nexplanon). Prescriptions can be filled at any retail pharmacy.  Emergency Contraception  Emergency contraception (the morning-after pill) consists of one dose of hormones that are given to decrease the likelihood of pregnancy when unprotected intercourse has occurred. It is most effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, but can be effective within up to 120 hours. Emergency contraception is currently available in Student Health and Wellness.Â No exam is required.Â Appointments are encouraged but walk-ins are welcome, wait times may vary.  Pregnancy Testing and Counseling  Pregnancy testing is available for a minimal fee. No exam is required.Â Â Appointments are encouraged but walk-ins are welcome, wait times may vary.Â If you have missed a period, had unprotected intercourse, had a birth control method failure, or are experiencing the symptoms of pregnancy, you should consider getting a pregnancy test. Some early signs of pregnancy are:   a missed menstrual period  breast tenderness or enlargement  fatigue  nausea  weight gain   Remember, pregnancy isnâ€™t the only reason for missing your period. Stress, anxiety, a change in birth control methods, changes in eating or exercise habits and even travel can affect your period.  Sexual Consent  It is important for every person to understand sexual consent and impairment.  Consent is positive cooperation involving an act of free will, absent of coercion, intimidation, force, or the threat of force. A person cannot give effective consent if they are impaired by the influence of drugs or alcohol.   After Hour Health Care Resources  Many students ask about what options are available for them to receive medical care when UMKC Student Health and Wellness is not open. Our After Hour Health Care Resources document provides several options for students, depending on the severity of their health concerns.

During this type of exam, a health care provider can check for abnormalities, infections, discuss normal findings, explain symptoms or changes in the body, and help educate about birth control and safe sex options that are available.  It is very normal to be nervous about your visit, particularly if you have never had an exam before. You may feel embarrassed to have a provider examine you, scared the exam will hurt, or you might be worried that something is wrong or you have a problem. Our goal is to give you information to help you be more prepared for the exam to hopefully ease any anxiety you might be feeling.  Please review our â€œ Preparing for your Annual Exam â€ information sheet to see what type of exam you need, how to prepare, and what to expect at your visit.   Birth control (contraceptives)  Birth control/contraceptive methods come in many different forms including hormonal, barrier, and natural family planning methods. All of these methods work to accomplish one goal: prevention of pregnancy. Some of the methods also provide the added benefit of protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs). When choosing a method, be sure and pick one you are likely to use consistently and correctly for the best protection rates. SHS providers are happy to discuss options available for contraception.  Contraceptive methods available at SHS:   Oral Contraceptives (the â€œpillâ€)  Ortho-Evra and NuvaRing (the â€œpatchâ€ or the â€œringâ€)  Depo-Provera (the â€œshotâ€)  â€œFemaleâ€ condoms  â€œMaleâ€ condoms  Diaphragms  Emergency Contraception*  Nexplanon  Intrauterine Device (IUD) (Paragard, Mirena, Kyleena)   * Emergency Contraception When at risk for pregnancy because of a condom break, missed pills without a backup method, sexual assault, etc taking a high dose of hormones decreases the likelihood of implantation of a fertilized egg. This must be done within 120 hours of the unprotected intercourse and is available at most pharmacies. No prescription is needed for individuals age 17 and older. A valid ECU 1Card is required for purchase. SHS will not sell emergency contraception to non students.  Not sure what type of contraceptive would be best for you? Check out www.bedsider.org for information on various methods available, pros/cons, etc.  Obtaining contraceptives at Student Health Services Condoms may be purchased over-the-counter in the Student Health Service Pharmacy.  To obtain birth control pills, Ortho-EvraÂ®, NuvaRingÂ®, Depo-ProveraÂ®, Nexplanon, an IUD, or to be fitted for a diaphragm, you must have an up to date annual exam (please see the section entitled â€œ Annual Exams and Pap Testing â€œ. If you have never been on prescription birth control previously, the â€œHealth Issues Classâ€ presentation must be viewed on our Welcome page prior to making an appointment. Once you have viewed the presentation and submitted your name and Banner ID at the end of the slideshow, call (252) 328-6841 or stop in to the appointment office inside Student Health to schedule your exam.  If you have had a recent exam at an outside provider but wish to have SHS prescribe you contraception, you must have your medical records sent to us prior to scheduling your appointment for a â€œcontraceptive consultationâ€. Viewing the presentation is only a requirement for the initial visit to obtain contraceptives and is not necessary for subsequent appointments for refills or changes in contraceptive method.  Student Health can also make referrals for anyone interested in other methods of contraception. On Depo and need to receive your injection? Check out our â€œ Depo Injection â€ information sheet for info on making an appointment. Have a general question about contraceptives? E-mail us at gotquestions@ecu.edu .   Breast health  The best way to notice changes in your breasts is to do a regular self-examâ€”if you do not know what is normal for you, you will not be able to notice changes in your breasts that could signal a problem. If you find a change, see your health care provider right away.  Most breast changes or lumps are NOT cancer. However, when breast cancer is found early, you have more treatment choices and a better chance of recovery. Regular breast self-exams are an important screening test you can perform to help with early detection of breast problems.  Breast self-exams should not take the place of regular screening mammograms or clinical breast exams, which are done by a healthcare provider.  What exactly are you looking for when you are doing a self-exam? It is hard to know what is â€œrightâ€ or â€œwrongâ€ for your body, unless you have a basic idea of what is normal for you. Breast Self-Exam (BSE) is a great way to establish a healthy level of self-awareness about your breast. Breast tissue is made up of glands and other tissue that can feel lumpy to the touch. The amount of lumpiness varies for each person.  You are looking for lumps that:   Stand out  Are 1/2 inch in size  Are persistent and unchanging  Represent any difference from normal breast tissue   Also note any changes in the skin around your breasts, any pain or discharge from your nipples, or any other finding that seems different than normal. It is important to know that the consistency of breast tissue changes throughout the life cycle and the monthly menstrual cycle. To learn how to perform a BSE, visit â€œThe Five Steps of a Breast Self Examâ€ .  If you notice any changes in your breasts, feel any lumps, or want to talk to a provider about breast health, please schedule an appointment.   Colposcopy/Abnormal Pap test (Main Campus SHS)   The Pap test can show when cells are abnormal on the cervix. It could be an area of atypia or dysplasia, which could be related to things like normal hormonal changes, or possibly to HPV (Human Papilloma Virus). In rare cases it may be early cancer. Atypia, dysplasia, and early cancer do not cause pain, itching, or discharge. It is important to obtain treatment for atypia or dysplasia if recommended by your health care provider.  If you have just found out that your Pap test is not normal, you are probably wondering â€œWhat now?â€ Depending on your age and your medical history, you may be asked to have Pap tests more frequently or you may be referred for a special test (colposcopy) that will help evaluate what was not normal about your Pap test.  To find out more about a colposcopy visit, including how to prepare and what to expect, read our Colposcopy Information handout,  Student Health does perform colposcopy, by appointment only. If you have had your Pap test at an outside providerâ€™s office and the procedure has been advised, please make sure to have your Pap records sent to SHS prior to scheduling your colposcopy. To schedule an appointment, or to find out pricing information, please call (252) 328-6841. Have a general question about abnormal Pap tests, colposcopy, or cervical cancer prevention? E-mail us at gotquestions@ecu.edu.   Lactation Support  Are you a nursing mother or know someone in need of a campus area to express milk? SHS has a lactation room available in our Main Campus SHS. There are also a number of lactation rooms available across campus. Access the list here .   Gynecological problems  SHS providers can evaluate a variety gynecological problems, including but not limited to:   Irregular vaginal bleeding  Painful periods  Ovarian cysts  PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome)  Yeast infections  Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) infections  STI symptoms  Vaginitis  Vaginal/vulvar cysts   It is best to avoid any vaginal creams, douching, or feminine soaps/deodorant sprays for the 24 hours prior to an appointment; these products can affect testing that may be done to evaluate your symptoms.  To schedule an appointment for a gynecological issue, please call (252) 328-6841.  Pregnancy  SHS offers pregnancy testing by appointment, or at-home pregnancy tests can be purchased at our pharmacy.  SHS does not provide prenatal care, ultrasound, or obstetrical services.  Providers can counsel regarding pregnancy options and will refer students who need prenatal care to a local Ob/Gyn office.  STI Testing    If you are symptom-free , you can schedule a visit with a nurse to test for chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, and/or syphilis. Make sure not to urinate within 1 hour of your appointment time (if you want oral screening for chlamydia/gonorrhea, do not eat/drink/chew for 1 hour prior to your appointment).  Having STI symptoms or need testing for warts or herpes? Make a clinic appointment with one of our providers.  Unsure what the symptoms of an STI might be? If you have any of these symptoms, you must schedule an appointment with a provider.  Unusual vaginal discharge, odor, burning, or itching  Pelvic pain or lower abdominal discomfort  Irregular vaginal bleeding that is not your period  Pain with intercourse  Sores, bumps, or blisters around your genital or anal area  Burning with urination  Penile drip or discharge  Swollen or tender testicles  Throat pain  Rectal bleeding, discharge, itching, or bumps   SHS recognizes that talking frankly and honestly about sexuality issues is uncomfortable for some people. It is important to remember that the more information you share with the health care provider, the better they can help to meet your needs. Quality health care begins with good communication between patients and health care providers. Be prepared to address topics concerning your sexual history, current sexual behavior, methods of contraception and STI risk reduction, and any current symptoms that you may be experiencing. These questions are asked for medical reasons and will ensure the best care possible. All information is confidential. Based on the shared information, your provider will determine appropriate tests for you.  You should consider getting tested for STIs if you have ever: â€“ Had unprotected (no barrier device was used) oral, vaginal, or anal sex with someone of an unknown STI status. â€“ Had intercourse under the influence of alcohol or other drugs and cannot remember what happened. â€“ Shared IV drug needles with an infected person or someone whose STI status was unknown. â€“ Had a past or current sex partner that told you of their infection with an STI.  Have a general question about STIs? E-mail us at gotquestions@ecu.edu .  Penile, Testicular and Prostate Problems  SHS providers can evaluate a variety of problems, including but not limited to:   STI symptoms  Painful urination  Prostatitis  Erectile dysfunction  Testicular discomfort  Testicular lumps   Cancer of the testes is one of the most common cancers in men 15-34 years of age. Like other cancers, if testicular cancer is discovered in the early stages it can be treated promptly and effectively.  What are the symptoms of testicular cancer?   A small hard lump about the size of a pea  Usually painless lump  Heavy feeling in the testicle  Enlargement of the testicle  Change in the consistency of the testicle  Dull ache in the testicle   The best means for early detection of testicular cancer is self-examination of the testicles. Testicular self-exam is a three minute monthly procedure that is completed after a warm bath or shower when the scrotum is most relaxed.  Testicular Self Examination   Examine the scrotum visually for swelling.  Examine each testicle separately by rolling the testicle between your thumb and the first two fingers of both hands. It is normal for one testicle to be larger than the other.  Check for lumps, swelling, or a change in size or consistency of the testicle.  Feel the epididymis, a cord-like structure, on the top and back of each testicle. Donâ€™t interpret this as an abnormality.  Make an appointment with a health care provider if any lumps or other abnormalities are found. Also, have your health care provider evaluate aching in the lower abdomen or groin, or a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, which may be a warning sign of cancer.

                  Although health insurance is not required for your visit to the University Health
                  Center, Cal U strongly recommends that all students have medical insurance coverage.  The campus Health Center offers a variety of healthcare services for Cal U students,
                  but it does not have any contracts for direct payment to any health insurance companies for clinic
                  or ancillary services, and it does not bill any insurance companies directly .  You are responsible for paying all bills for clinic visits, medications, lab work
                  and certain procedures that you may need outside of the Cal U Health Center.  If you are not currently covered by a health insurance plan, it is recommended that
                  you visit Healthcare.gov to explore your options for coverage on the insurance marketplace.  Read an open letter to students from Pennsylvania's Office of the Insurance Commissioner.  Get help with stressful situations at the Counseling Center.  The Counseling Center advises students on ways to make the best personal, social, psychological and career
                  choices during a time of transition in their lives. The center can make referrals
                  to a long-term treatment provider and direct you to other campus resources.

Check out the services offered here at Etter!  ***Services at the Health Center are limited during the summer, fall, winter and spring breaks. Please contact the office if you have questions regarding services provided during these times.            Care of Chronic Illness      If you have a chronic illness that requires periodic or regular medication or testing, and it is not feasible to have a regular follow-up with your home physician, then you may make an appointment with one of our physicians who will collaborate with your home physician to make sure you are receiving appropriate care.  If you run out of medication or a prescription expires for a chronic health condition while you are at school, you should first call your home physician to see if he or she can send a prescription to your local pharmacy before making an appointment with our physician. We will, of course, be glad to treat you for acute episodes of a chronic illness such as migraine headaches or asthma flare-ups.           Contraception      If it is not feasible to obtain a contraceptive prescription from your home physician, you now have two options available to you here on campus.   You may go to www.nurx.com and complete an online consultation.Â  This program will ask you a series of questions regarding your health history.Â  Based on your answers to these questions, if it is appropriate and safe, this program will set you up with oral contraception, transdermal patch or a vaginal ring.Â  While some insurances are accepted, it is NOT needed.Â  Cost for this program will be $15-$30 for a 3 month prescription without insurance.  You may schedule an appointment with our physician.Â  The following contraceptives may be prescribed here at the health center:    Oral contraceptive pills  Depo Provera injection   We do not provide these contraceptives to you but we can provide a prescription that can be filled at any pharmacy. We currently do not place IUDs or implants.  If your home physician prescribes the Depo Provera injection, this can be given at the health center if it is not practical to receive the injection at your home physician's office. A brief appointment with our physician will be required prior to initiating the injections at the health center. Be sure to schedule this appointment at least one week before the first injection is due.  The following resources may help you in your decisions regarding sex, contraception, sexually transmitted infections, and pregnancy:  Choosing a contraception method  Overview of sexually transmitted infections           Health Screenings      As part of our ongoing effort to help you stay healthy, we are engaged in the following screening activities:  1. Screening for alcohol misuse: We are vigilant in identifying students who are misusing alcohol and encourage students to speak to fellow students who are misusing alcohol to avail themselves to the following resource on campusâ€‹: http://www.ship.edu/connections/ . Further information can also be found at:  http://www.ship.edu/Dean_of_Students/Connections/Links_-_Students/ http://www.ship.edu/Dean_of_Students/Connections/Links_-_Parents/ 2. Screening for tobacco use: We are vigilant in identifying students who are using tobacco and encourage students to speak to fellow students who are using tobacco to avail themselves to the following resource: https://myfcph.org/health-systems-planning/community-health/tobacco/  3. Screening for obesity: We are in the midst of an obesity epidemic. There is perhaps no better place to curb this epidemic than on college campuses. The health center is partnering with the dining services in encouraging students to become engaged with the USDA program My Plate on Campus. We would like all students to look at the excellent information at http://www.choosemyplate.gov/MyPlateOnCampus/ to guide you in making healthy food choices and in obtaining or maintaining a healthy weight. We would also like some of our students to become ambassadors with the My Plate on Campus program.  For those struggling with obesity and weight related health problems, we encourage you to make an appointment with the health center. Many insurance plans now cover weight loss services and in some cases we may refer you to a weight loss specialist.  4. Screening for depression: We partner with the counseling center in identifying and treating students who are struggling with depression or other mental health related problems. We encourage all students to be aware of fellow students who may be depressed and encourage them to call the counseling center. More information regarding the counseling center can be found at http://www.ship.edu/counseling_center/ .  â€‹5. Screening for sexually transmitted infections: All sexually active college students are encouraged to be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea every year. This is typically done as part of a women's annual wellness visit with her home physician. Screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men and other sexually transmitted infections in both men and women may also be indicated based on other personal risk factors. If you have sex please review the following article to determine if STI screening is indicated for you: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/std-testing/ID00047/METHOD=print . We can screen sexually transmitted infection at the health center. However, for some infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia we have to send collected specimens to Quest Labs who will bill you or your insurance for the tests.  For students who would like to attend the STI screening clinics you may walk in on a first come, first serve basis during the following dates/times.  Next walk-in STI Screening Clinic :  Thursday, May 2ndÂ  Â  Â 1pm - 4pm  Please bring your insurance card with you for this clinic.  If you are experiencing symptoms of an STI or have had known exposure to someone who has been diagnosed with an STI, please contact our office to schedule an appointment with our doctor.           Illness Prevention and Health Maintenance      Most insurance companies cover wellness visits and screening for specific diseases.

Your PCP is someone you can turn to with health questions, either in the context of an appointment or via our secure messaging system .  If desired, switching PCPs is simply a matter of speaking to our front desk staff or making a request during an appointment.

Transgender Health   Student Health serves all students, including those who identify as gender-variant, transgender and/or transsexual. We recognize that transgender students are sometimes hesitant to access health care, so we work hard to create and maintain a space where students can ask questions, get answers, and get compassionate health care in a supportive environment.  We collaborate with the trans student to offer full spectrum care: to address acute, chronic and preventative health care needs, as well as services related to students who wish to transition. The primary care providers at SHS can initiate or continue prescription hormones, provide appropriate follow-up, and refer to specialists knowledgeable in gender transition as needed/preferred. We, along with our CAPS colleagues, believe it is important to provide ongoing support and primary care services with respect and knowledge of the medical and emotional issues unique to transitioning.

Take our survey on accessibility and availability to condoms on the UW campus at tinyurl.com/safersexsuppliesuw .   Currently, in stock:  Condoms   Lube  Good Clean Love Lube (water-based)  Oasis Lube (water-based)  Move lube (silicone-based)  Dental dams (latex)  Satin dams (flavored or unflavored)  Finger cots (latex)  Gloves (latex)  *Always check the expiration date on your safer sex supplies!      Condoms   What are condoms?  Condoms are thin, latex pouches worn on the penis to collect semen during penetrative sex. TheyÂ help protect against unwanted pregnancies and STDs by preventing contact with semen, vaginal fluids and limiting skin-to-skin contact.Â Â Lambskin condoms do not protect against STDs; only latex/non-latex condoms do.  The video below explains how to put a condom on. Remember to use water-based or silicon-based lube when using condoms, not oil-based!   Even if you are using another form of birth control , such as the pill or the IUD, condoms are the only type of birth control that also protect you from sexually transmitted infections.  Internal condoms  Internal condoms are another great option for protection against pregnancy or STIs.Â An internal condom is inserted into the vagina or anus in advance of sexual activity.Â Follow this guide on how to insert an internal condom.      Why dental dams, finger cots, and gloves?     Dental Dams  Safer sex measures go beyond just penetrative sex. A dental dam is a thin, flexible piece of latex that protects against direct mouth-to-genital contact during oral sex. Dams act as a barrier to reduce risks of infections.  Many STIs can be spread through oral sex, including:   Syphilis  Gonorrhea  Chlamydia  Hepatitis  HIV   You can lower the chances of giving or getting STIs during oral sex by using a dental dam. Remember to check expiration dates! Dams come in latex and non-latex varieties. Here is an informational video on how to use a dental dam and how to make one from a condom!     Finger cots and gloves  Finger cots are small, latex sheaths that fit from the fingertip to the base of the finger. Finger cots and gloves reduce the risk of infections with manual sex, including fingering and handjobs.Â You can find both latex and non-latex options.  Why are they useful?   Genital tissue is tender and sensitive. Using finger cots or gloves can reduce irritation and potential genital tears by covering tough fingers and nails.  Finger cots also can reduce the risk of exposure to viruses or bacteria in bodily secretions and provide protection for any broken skin on the hands.

Sexual Health is a state of physical, mental, and social well-being in relation to
            sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction, or infirmity. Sexual
            health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships,
            as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free
            of coercion, discrimination, and violence.  For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons
               must be respected, protected, and fulfilled.  Sexual Health and Gynecology at Student Health Services offers confidential examinations,
            testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), contraceptives management, and
            additional gynecological services. Call (813) 974-2331 or click here to make an appointment. PLEASE NOTE: STI testing is available at student rates. Ask
            about free STI testing in collaboration with our community partners.  CONTRACEPTIVES  In addition, Student Health Services offers a wide range of contraceptive services
               to include:   Contraceptive counseling  Free Condoms  Prescriptions for birth control pills, rings or patches  Placement of IUDs and Long Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC)  Contraceptive implants  Emergency Contraception  Birth Control Injections   For more information on these methods visit:  Birth Control: Planned Parenthood  Contraceptive options and other topics: Bedsider  Sexual Health and You: I wanna know!

Bridge Plan-discount Program (Downtown Phoenix, Tempe, Polytechnic, West) ASU Health Services is pleased to offer a Bridge service discount program designed to save the student money if they need certain health services at the University. ASU health service's mission is to provide quality health care at low cost to the students at ASU. Even though you have health insurance, it may not cover everyday health expenses like preventive or routine visits, lab tests, x-rays or consultations with an on-campus specialist. Many of the insurance plans require a higher deductible, or no coverage when the student is ""out of network"". ASU Health Services now offers a discount program to pay for some of these services. THIS IS NOT AN INSURANCE POLICY. It is a way to reduce your total health care costs for certain services rendered at any of the ASU Health Services locations. Like the  Aetna Student Insurance  plan, you will automatically be re-enrolled for future semesters (Enrollment for the Bridge plan is open all semester for $129 with benefits beginning on the Bridge form enrollment date).

You may also request an itemized statement for you to submit to your insurance company for reimbursement.Â You should be familiar with the rule of your insurance to receive the best benefit.Â  Most HMO plans have very specific rules about who and where you can be seen, usually only with your selected primary care provider.Â Â  (We are not able to bill to all versions of the following plans) Some labs may be sent out to Sonora Quest Labs or Labcorp.

Bridge Plan-discount Program (Downtown Phoenix, Tempe, Polytechnic, West) ASU Health Services is pleased to offer a Bridge service discount program designed to save the student money if they need certain health services at the University. ASU health service's mission is to provide quality health care at low cost to the students at ASU. Even though you have health insurance, it may not cover everyday health expenses like preventive or routine visits, lab tests, x-rays or consultations with an on-campus specialist. Many of the insurance plans require a higher deductible, or no coverage when the student is ""out of network"". ASU Health Services now offers a discount program to pay for some of these services. THIS IS NOT AN INSURANCE POLICY. It is a way to reduce your total health care costs for certain services rendered at any of the ASU Health Services locations. Like the  Aetna Student Insurance  plan, you will automatically be re-enrolled for future semesters (Enrollment for the Bridge plan is open all semester for $129 with benefits beginning on the Bridge form enrollment date).

Services:  Contraception ( pills , Depo-Provera, Nexplanon, IUDs, emergency contraception)  Sexually transmitted infections (screening and treatment)  Pap testing and treatment of abnormal Paps (biopsy, Colposcopy , LEEP)  Treatment of genital warts, HPV vaccine  Pregnancy Testing  Preconception counseling  Routine gynecological exams  Evaluation and treatment for a full range of gynecologic problems (including abnormal bleeding, pelvic pain, menopause and breast concerns)  Transgender hormone therapy  The Women's Health Center will provide a private exam room with seating, handwashing area, electrical outlets, (for pumping), for use by breast feeding women in this Lactation-Adapted Area. Women requesting use of this area will be directed to the 2nd floor WHC area by reception.  Visit the Phone, Location & Hours web page for more information or call (520) 621-6490 if you have questions.  Appointments & Cancellations  If you are unable to keep your appointment, please call (520) 621-6490 at least 24 hours in advance, (if you are having a procedure), 1 hour for office visit to avoid a no-show fee. These fees range from $15 - $30 depending on the time allotted for the appointment. This also enables us to open the appointment time for another patient.  Please arrive 20 minutes early to fill out the health form. Specific case-related medical questions will be reviewed with a doctor or nurse practitioner. Our providers are also available as needed by appointment.  PatientLink is available for cancelling and scheduling appointments online.  Click to Access PatientLink  Birth Control and Other Prescription Refills  At your annual exam, you will generally be given a 1-year refill for your contraception.  Refills for Prescriptions Written at the Women's Health Clinic  We want to help you get your prescription refills as quickly as possible. After you call for your refill, please allow time for us to access and review your individual patient record. We ask you to call at least 48 hours in advance of your prescription needs.  If you have not been seen in our Women's Health Clinic for more than one year, and you need an interval (few month) refill on your birth control (until you can have an annual appointment with WHC), a $10 fee will be charged to your bursar account for generating the refill prescription.  It is always preferable that you make and keep your annual gynecology appointment and at that time you will receive your refill for a year, as part of that visit.  Refills for Outside Prescriptions  If you have authorized refills at your pharmacy and would like to have your prescription transferred to the Campus Health Pharmacy, please check with the pharmacy staff for details.  Contraceptive prescriptions need annual renewal, therefore you need to schedule a birth control consultation visit in WHC (schedule online or via reception: (520) 621-6490). We will review your medical history, current prescriptions and have you sign our Birth Control Consent form. At the end of that visit you will receive a prescription for the Birth Control we have selected with you and that prescription will usually provide refills for one year.  Pap tests are started at age 21, but STD testing is recommended annually for sexually active young people. Depending on your history you may need a pelvic exam and/or additional testing at our lab.  If you have had evaluation and care at an outside clinic/doctor's office for gynecological issues, (abnormal periods, abnormal paps, infection, cysts, surgery, etc.), we ask that you have those medical records from the previous provider faxed to us: (520) 621-5510.  We cannot prescribe for patients we have never seen. You must establish care with us for us to be able to prescribe for you.  If you are calling for birth control refill prescriptions and are an enrolled patient of ours, allow 48 hours for complete processing of the request.  Depo-Provera  If you have had your gynecological care, (outside of Campus Health) within the past year and just need your depo injection administered here, provide a copy of your last pap, (if you are 21 years of age or older), gynecological exam and the date of your last injection.  You will need an appointment with a provider in Women's Health to begin to receive your medication here. (A consent form is also required).  If you prefer to provide your own Depo-Provera medication, discuss with the provider at your appointment.  Emergency Contraception  Emergency contraception, (generic Plan B), is available over-the-counter in any pharmacy. It can be purchased by anyone 17 years of age or older.Â  Plan B should be taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse.  ""Ella"" is a prescription emergency contraception pill that can be effective for up to 5 daysâ€™ post intercourse. An appointment with a Womenâ€™s Health Center provider is required for this prescription - call (520) 621-6493.

It is best to keep in mind the wishes, fears, and preferences of you and your partner. Though there are several forms of reliable birth control, none of these methods are perfect. It is important to practice safe sex and realize that any of these family planning methods are prone to failure.  Listed below are different forms of both prescription-required and non-prescription required birth control options:  Methods Requiring a Prescription:   ""The Pill"" / Oral Contraceptives: Hormones from the pill will prevent the ovaries from releasing an egg, while also thickening the cervical mucous to further prevent sperm from reaching it. It is a contraceptive taken daily.    ""The Shot"" / Depo-Provera: This hormone-containing injection suppresses ovulation and thickens cervical mucous. It is a good option for those wishing to avoid using estrogen or taking a daily pill. For the best outcome, the shot should be received every 12 weeks.    ""The Ring"" / NuvaRing: A small synthetic ring is inserted into the vagina, and remains in place for three weeks, followed by one week without it. Similarly, the ring uses hormones to prevent ovulation and thicken cervical mucous.    ""The Patch"" / Ortho Evra: ""The Patch"" is a bandaid-sized hormone patch that is applied to a designated area of skin. It is changed once a week for three weeks, and followed by one week without. Like the above hormone contraceptives, it stops the ovary from releasing and egg, and also thickens cervical mucous.    Diaphragm:Â A diaphragm is a rubber cap that holds spermicidal jelly or cream against the cervix. The diaphragm acts as a physical barrier to keep sperm out of the reproductive tract, while the spermicide acts as a chemical backup to kill any sperm that may have gotten around the rim of the diaphragm.    ""The Implant"" / Nexplanon:Â An implant that is placed just under the skin in the arm to provide up to 3 years of continuous birth control. Â Does not contain estrogen and works to prevent pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation and thickening cervical mucous. Â The implant is inserted by a trained professional in the office.    IUD / Skyla, Mirena or Paraguard:Â Intrauterine devices can provide long-term reversible contraception anywhere from 3, 5 to 10 years. Â These devices work to prevent pregnancy by inhibiting sperm from fertilizing the egg. Â This contraceptive option also does not contain estrogen and Paraguard does not contain any hormone (good option for those who cannot take hormone contraceptives). Â IUD's are also inserted in the office by a trained professional.   Methods Not Requiring a Prescription:   Male Condoms:Â Worn by the male, male condoms act as a physical barrier to keep sperm from entering the female reproductive organs. They can also work to protect against sexually transmitted infections.    Female Condoms:Â Female condoms are inserted into the woman's vagina, and prevent sperm from entering the female reproductive organs. Like male condoms, female condoms can prevent sexually transmitted infections.

Please arrive early or on time.    Workshops begin on schedule.    If you arrive late, you will need to reschedule.      During this fun and interactive workshop, we will discuss:   Birth Control Methods  STIs and HIV  The Well Woman Exam  Safer sex tips  Partner Communication    Frequently Asked Questions    What is a Well Woman Exam?   A well woman exam includes:    A review of your health history  A physical exam that includes a clinical breast exam and may include a pelvic exam.  STI tests for chlamydia or gonorrhea (optional)  Will include a Pap test if you are 21 or older     Who can attend the workshop?   Everyone is welcome to attend the workshop. We strongly encourage you to bring a friend, your partner, etc.    I heard it is required if you want to get on the pill. Is this true?   The workshop is not required; however, it is strongly recommended for women who have never used  hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills, the NuvaRing, or the implant. The workshop is also recommended for women who have never had a well woman exam.    When do I get my prescription for birth control?   When you schedule your well woman exam, your clinician will  review your health history, family health history, and give you a prescription  for birth control. You can fill the prescription at the SHS pharmacy or one  that is more convenient for you, such as CVS or Target.   If you have had a well woman visit in the last year, you do not need another exam. To get your prescription, make an appointment at the front desk after attending the workshop.     What if I cannot make it to the workshop due to a schedule conflict?   If you cannot attend the regularly scheduled times that we offer, we will attempt to provide you with an individual session at a more convenient time.

Some of these Specialists may require a referral from one of our Primary Care providers, while others do not. However, they all require an appointment. You can speak with your provider in the General Medical Clinic to determine if you need a referral to see one of the specialists listed below. If your SHC provider refers you for specialty medical services that are not offered on-site, then you will be referred to either UCI Medical Center, another UCI Health affiliated provider or to a community provider that is convenient for the patient and who is in the SHIP PPO network.             Womenâ€™s Health         One of our most active clinics, the Women's Health Clinic is staffed by OB/Gynecologists, Womenâ€™s Health Nurse Practitioners, as well as Family Medicine physicians specially trained in Womenâ€™s Health. Services offered include comprehensive women's exams, Pap smears, screening for infections, contraceptive counseling and prescriptions, and insertion of Intrauterine Devices (IUD). Endocrine problems, abnormal pap smears, breast lumps, chronic pelvic pain, and other complex women's health problems are also evaluated and treated by the staff of our Womenâ€™s Health Clinic. You may request an appointment with one of our Womenâ€™s Health providers directly, or your primary care provider will refer you to our on-site OB/GYN or to one in the community.  The Student Health Center provides several options for contraceptive management. Since there are many factors to consider when making this important decision, your SHC provider is available to assist you in determining the safest and most appropriate method based upon your individual needs and preferences. Please visit the Online Birth Control Prescription Request page for additional information and instructions.   Please note that the services described above may be relevant for students with a variety of gender identities including ciswomen, transmen, transwomen and gender non-conforming people. Our team is currently working to make this language more inclusive. We ask for and appreciate your patience, support and input.    UCSHIP Transgender Benefits Flier (2018-19)  Transgender Providers              Dermatology         Your experienced Primary Care provider should be capable of treating the majority of your skin problems, such as acne, eczema, and other rashes. However, there are times when consultation and management from a Dermatologist may be necessary. In that case, your primary care provider will refer you to our on-site UCI Health Dermatologist or another Dermatologist in the community.  If you have already established care with a UCI Health dermatologist or a dermatologist in the community, you may contact the SHC Insurance Services Department directly at shc-insurance@uci.edu or by calling 949-824-2388 to obtain a referral to continue to see your specialist.             Otolaryngology (Ear, Nose, and Throat)         Otolaryngology is the specialty in medicine that deals with illness and disease of the Ear, Nose, or Throat (ENT). Although your Primary Care provider is trained to handle the majority of medical conditions, including sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and pharyngitis (throat infections), there are times when persistent symptoms or other structural problems (large tonsils or broken nose) may require evaluation and treatment from an ENT specialist. In that case, your primary care provider will refer you to our on-site ENT physician or one in the community.             Orthopedics/Sports Medicine         We are truly fortunate at the UCI Student Health Center to have the on-site services of an experienced Orthopedic Surgeon, in addition to 2 full-time Board Certified Sports Medicine providers. Whether it was getting body-checked at that broom ball game, or the epic wipeout you took while surfing, this clinic attends to patients referred for all your joint, back, or muscle symptoms and/or injuries. You may request an appointment with one of our Sports Medicine providers directly, and your primary care provider will refer you to our on-site Orthopedist or one in the community.             Gastroenterology         Our Primary Care providers should be capable of treating the majority of your stomach, digestive, and intestinal problems, such as abdominal pain, reflux, and acute vomiting/diarrhea. However, there are times when symptoms may become more severe, and consultation and management from a Gastroenterologist may be necessary. In that case, your primary care provider will refer you to our on-site UCI Health Gastroenterologist or another one in the community.             Chiropractic Services         Chiropractic is a health care profession that focuses on disorders of the musculoskeletal system and the nervous system, and the effects of these disorders have on general health. Doctors of Chiropractic practice a drug-free, hands-on approach to health care that includes patient examination, diagnosis and treatment.  Chiropractors have broad diagnostic skills and are specially trained in manipulation of the spine and extremities, as well as recommend therapeutic and rehabilitative exercises. Chiropractors provide nutritional, dietary and lifestyle counseling. Doctors of chiropractic may assess patients through clinical examination, diagnostic imaging, laboratory testing and other diagnostic methods.  The most common therapeutic procedure performed by doctors of chiropractic is known as â€œmanipulation,â€ also called â€œchiropractic adjustment.â€ The purpose of manipulation is to restore joint function by manually applying a controlled force into joints to restore normal alignment and movement. Diagnosis and treatment is not limited to spinal conditions. Chiropractic doctors are often consulted for conditions of the extremities including, but not limited to, the shoulders, hips and knees. A chiropractic treatment program may include manipulation, deep tissue techniques, application of kinesio-tape, instrument assisted soft tissue and/or manipulation, cold laser treatments and orthotics.  Chiropractors will readily refer patients to the appropriate health care provider when chiropractic care is not suitable for the patientâ€™s condition or the condition warrants co-management with other members of the health care team.  Chiropractic Interns are in their last year of their doctoral program and they rotate on a 12 month basis. While on rotation at the Student Health Center, the interns treat patients under the supervision of a licensed chiropractor.             Chronic Medical Care and Disease Management         Many students enter UCI with an ongoing or chronic medical condition (Diabetes, Epilepsy, Asthma, etc.) which typically requires regular care, testing, and management. In some cases, these conditions may develop and become diagnosed during your time here at UCI. The Primary Care team is staffed with Board Certified Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, and Pediatric providers who are experienced and trained to manage even the most complicated of health and chronic disease conditions. Even if your particular health condition requires the support of a Specialist (Endocrinology, Neurology, Allergist, etc.), it is important that you be seen and followed by one of our Primary Care providers, who may serve to help maintain, monitor, and coordinate your care.  If you have an urgent health problem, we will do our best to provide you with a same day appointment. In addition, you may choose to walk-in and see if a medical clinic, specialty clinic or nurse triage clinic appointment slot is available at that time. If no appointments are available at SHC during normal hours of operation and your health problem is urgent or emergent, you will be referred either to a nearby urgent care center or hospital emergency room that is in the SHIP PPO network.

Consider the followingÂ questions as you decide on the method that is the best for you. You may also make an appointment with a Health Educator to discuss birth control options in more detailÂ by callingÂ (858)Â 534-1824.  Does the method you choose have enough sexually transmitted infection (STI) and  pregnancy protection for you? Will this method fit your lifestyle and budget? How often do you have intercourse? Are you comfortable with touching your genitals? What level of involvement does your partner(s) have when making birth control decisions? Birth Control MethodÂ Fact Sheets The following birth control method fact sheets are provided by the Reproductive Health Access Project . Intrauterine Device (IUD): English | Chinese | Spanish Birth Control Implant: English | Chinese | Spanish Birth Control Shot: English | Chinese | Spanish Birth Control Pill: English | Chinese | Spanish Birth Control Mini Pill (Progestin-Only Pill): English | Chinese | Spanish Birth Control Patch: English | Chinese | Spanish  Birth Control Vaginal Ring: English | Chinese | Spanish Diaphragm: English | Chinese | Spanish External (Male) Condom: English | Chinese | Spanish Internal (Female) Condom: English | Chinese | Spanish Fertility Awareness Methods, including Abstinence: English | Chinese | Spanish Withdrawal : This method involves pulling the penis out of the vagina before ejaculation. Withdrawal is approximately 76% effective in preventing pregnancy.  Birth Control Choices Chart: English | Chinese | Spanish Birth Control for Men Chart: English | Chinese | Spanish Non-Prescription Birth Control Methods Chart: English | Chinese BirthÂ Control Across the Gender Spectrum  English Emergency ContraceptiveÂ Pill The emergency contraceptive pill (ECP), previously called the ""morning after pill"", is a method of preventing pregnancy from occurring after an incident of unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure (i.e. condom breaks, etc.). The emergency contraceptive pillÂ  works by delayingÂ ovulation. EContra EZ Â® and ellaÂ® , the brands of ECP carried at Student Health Services (SHS), can be takenÂ up toÂ 72Â hours (EContraEZ) or 120 hours (ella)Â after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure; however, the sooner ECP is taken the more effective it will be. EContra EZÂ® does not require a prescription and can be obtained over-the-counter at the SHSÂ Pharmacy. EContra EZÂ® costs approximately $20 at Student Health Services, however, if youÂ haveÂ a prescription, it is free with SHIP. ella Â® requires a prescription and is free with SHIP,Â or $48Â without SHIP. ECP is for emergencies only. Using ECP is less effective at preventing pregnancy than using birth control that is used before or during sex (e.g. birth control pills, condom, etc.).Â ECP is not the abortion pill. If you are already pregnant, ECP will not cause an abortion. Note: The Copper IUD can also be used as a method of emergency contraception if placed within 5 days after unprotected intercourse.

Nominal fees are charged for pharmaceuticals, certain lab tests, summer visits, and to participants in pre-designated special SSU enrollment programs.  A. The initial medical visit for an individual seeking hormonal contraception at SSU includes:   Prior to initial visit, go to the SSU Student Health Center webpage, go to Forms & Instructions. Click on Women's Health Packet and complete the Checklist included in the packet.  Clinician review of the patient's pertinent women's health medical history, individualized women's health and contraceptive consultation, and limited physical exam as indicated.  Pap smear, pelvic exam and/or breast exam only as indicated by age, symptoms, previous findings, standard recommendations for patient age, etc. Pap testing is not recommended before age 21.  Chlamydia testing and testing for other sexually transmitted infection as indicated. (Chlamydia testing is recommended annually for all sexually active women under age 25 - with or without symptoms, and for women of any age with symptoms or a new sex partner since their last recent chlamydia test.)     B. Periodic Women's Health Maintenance Visits    Periodic women's health maintenance visits as medically indicated are also available in accordance with standard CDC and Preventive Services Task Force guidelines for women that are not seeking contraception from the Student Health Center: This may include a review of the patient's women's health related medical history, physical exam and lab testing only as indicated by medical history, symptoms age, and other factors.

Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECPs) Are:   Hormonal preparations that can help reduce the risk of pregnancy following unprotected intercourse.  Are available via a medical visit or from a Pharmacy.  Designed for use in unexpected situations of unprotected intercourse, such as method failure Â or sexual assault.  Most effective when used ASAP and within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, but may work if taken up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse.  Are not a substitute for or a reliable method of ongoing contraception  Get more information at 707 664-2921; the Princeton Emergency Contraception Website   D. Pregnancy Testing:   Home test kits are available at a low cost at the SSU SHC Pharmacy. Medical visits with a Nurse Practitioner or an RN are available by appointment. These are best scheduled only if you are at least 5 days late with your period or have symptoms that concern you or if you have had a positive home pregnancy test.   E. Pharmacy Services - See http://www.sonoma.edu/shc/services/pharmacy/html   Prescription contraceptives are dispensed only to SSU students who have received a medical evaluation and prescription from the SSU Student Health Center. A brief appointment for a one-month prescription of continuing hormonal contraceptives can be arranged pending a student's full examination here. SHC prescriptions may also be filled at off-campus pharmacies at the student's own expense. Condoms, foam, home pregnancy tests, etc. are available at low cost without a prescription.    Contraceptive Options available at the SSU Student Health Center 664-2921  No prescription required:   Condoms: Male & Female  more effective @ pregnancy prevention when used w/spermicide. Help protect against sexually transmitted infection.  Spermicides: foam, jelly, film) prevents sperm from reaching and fertilizing an egg. Usually best used in conjunction with condoms.  Much less effective when used alone than when used in combination with condoms.   Prescription required:  Hormonal Contraceptives: Hormonal contraceptives contain estrogen & progesterone (or progesterone alone) & prevent pregnancy by suppressing the release of eggs from the ovary as well as by causing cervical mucus to thicken  which interferes with sperm motility. They do not protect against sexually transmitted infection.  Birth Control Pills (combined estrogen and progesterone)  Reversible, and generally safe and reliable when used correctly; have non-contraceptive benefits (e.g. reduction in menstrual flow, discomfort, and anemia; decreased risk of ovarian and uterine cancer).  Must be taken at the same time each day; reduced efficacy in obese individuals..  Possible minor side effects: (e.g. nausea, headache, fluid retention, depression)..  Possible serious side effects (rare - but some of these are more common in smokers): blood clots, heart attack, stroke, blood pressure increase, glucose intolerance, gall bladder or liver problems.    Nuva Ring (Vaginal Ring) or Contraceptive Patch - contains estrogen and progesterone  Similar to the combined birth control pill in effectiveness, action, and side effects. Hormones are delivered by a flexible polymer ring that is placed in the vagina, left in place for 3 weeks, and removed for one week or by an adhesive square applied to the skin weekly that contains estrogen and progesterone.  There is less theoretical chance of nausea and no daily pill taking required with these methods, but there is probably a greater failure rate in obese individuals.  Either of these two methods have been associated with a higher risk of blood clots, heart attack, or stroke in some women.   Depo Provera is a progesterone only injectable contraceptive given at 3-month intervals.  Convenient 99% effective contraception without the need to remember a daily pill.  Contains no estrogen, avoids estrogen related side effects; o.k. for use in nursing mothers.  Reduced menses, menstrual cramps, anemia, spotting and possible irregular menses may occur.  Reversible method, but return of ovulation may be delayed.  Possible progestin related side effects (e.g. acne, fluid retention, weight gain, depression).  Long-term use may reduce bone mineral density and increase the risk of osteoporosis later in life. Therefore, the FDA currently recommends that the use of Depo Provera beyond 2 years should occur only if other birth control methods are not adequate for the individual.

Information on a Sexual Assault Nurse Examination (SANE) .  Appointment Information  There are lots of reasons to schedule an appointment with the Sexual and Reproductive Health Clinic. Itâ€™s important to come in for an annual wellness exam at least once a yearÂ and to get tested for STIs every 6 months or anytime you have a new partner. As some infections and health conditions may not have symptoms, these check-ups ensure that you stay healthy and receive any treatment early on to prevent complications.  If youâ€™re experiencing any symptoms, like unusual discharge, itchiness, frequent urination or burning while urinating, itâ€™s important to come in and speak with a provider as soon as possible. If youâ€™re interested in birth control or hormone therapy, itâ€™s also good to schedule an initial consultation and any follow-up visits.  Walk-in appointments are available for some services (like pregnancy testing) but making an appointment in advance is the best way to guarantee a time that works for your schedule. Find out more about the process below!  Schedule an Appointment  Schedule an appointment by callingÂ 303-492-2030 or  online through MyCUHealth .   Checking in:  If itâ€™s your first appointment to the Sexual and Reproductive Health Clinic please arrive 15 minutes early to complete necessary forms. Our doors open at 7:30 a.m.; If your appointment is at 7:30 a.m., please arrive at that time to check in.  Arriving more than 5 minutes late may result in your being rescheduled.  What to Expect During Your Visit  Itâ€™s normal to feel apprehensive about a visit with a healthcare provider. Knowing what to expect and preparing for the visit can help.  During the Visit  Most visits will begin with a conversation with your healthcare provider. They may ask about your sexual and reproductive health history, as well as any issues you may be experiencing. We try to get all the information needed to provide you with the best care possible, and we want you to feel comfortable sharing that with usâ€”we are nonjudgmental, specially trained in college health, and here for you along the way.  Depending on the reason for the visit, your provider may proceed with testing, an examination, or talking through care options. These processes are simple, and depending on the concern at hand, can include taking samples or swabs; if you have questions, your provider will be happy to talk through the specific processes with you.  Follow-up Results from these tests come back fairly quickly. Your provider will communicate with you about the results from any tests or exams and may recommend a follow-up visit.  You are welcome to reach out to your provider in this ongoing process, too. The online patient portal, MyCUHealth ,Â has a secure messaging feature that allows you to communicate with your provider if you have questions, concernsÂ or want any more information.  Your health is important, and we want you to be empowered to take it on!  Appointment Cancellation Policy  Appointments must be cancelled by 5PM theÂ businessÂ day before your appointment by calling 303-492-2030.  Late cancellations and missed appointments will result in a $30 charge.  Resources  Beforeplay.org  Bedsider.org  Centers for Disease Control (CDC): STDs  Go Ask Alice!

ByÂ accessing the available medical resources, studentsÂ learn how to care for themselvesÂ and are better prepared toÂ identify and addressÂ potential health and wellness concernsÂ in a holistic, timely, andÂ convenient manner.Â As a result, students are more likely to remain active and engaged on campus and focused onÂ meeting their academic goals.

In the event vaccinations are no longer available, students will be offered a prescription to take to a pharmacy of choice. * Students who are under 18 will need permission from their legal guardian *  What is HPV?  HPV is a very common virus that affects both men and women; approximately one in four people are infected in the United States. About 14 million people, including teens, become infected with HPV each year. While most strains of the HPV virus resolve spontaneously, there are a few dangerous HPV strains that are known to cause cancer in both men and women. Every year in the United States, HPV causes 30,700 cancers in men and women, including genital warts, oral cancer, and cancers of the cervix and penis. Approximately 75% to 80% of the population will contract HPV in their lifetime.  The HPV vaccination is currently the only immunization available that prevents these cancers from occurring!

Support and Resource Team (SART)  Southern Connecticut State University's Support and Resource Team (SART) is designed to provide a collaborative victim-centered team response to sexual violence. The mission of SART is to provide services that ensure a transition from victim to survivor for every individual whose life is impacted by sexual violence. SART members can provide a survivor with many supportive options including counseling, medical attention, judicial services, advocacy, referrals, and general information regarding sexual violence. Should a survivor choose to file a police report, the University Police and Violence Prevention, Victim Advocacy and Support Center (VPAS) staff will assist the individual with the reporting process. We strive to empower the survivor to make their own decisions by providing on- and off-campus resources, offer support as needed, and hold perpetrators accountable. The SART members will keep confidentiality to the best of their ability.  The SART has been designated by the Division of Student Affairs to handle sexual assault cases. The team includes a coordinator and designated individuals from throughout the University. The Support And Resource Team is available to help anyone who reports a violation of the sexual misconduct policy. In cases of immediate danger or an emergency, call the University Police at 911.  For information or to report sexual violence, students may contact any member of the team. Please visit the Violence Prevention, Victim Advocacy and Support Center websiteÂ for team members' contact information and details of services.

If you do need a prescription renewal for birth control and your current prescription will run out before your appointment, let a nurse or receptionist know so that we can arrange for you to pick up a one-month supply for coverage until your appointment. Hours of operation and appointment instructions are available here .  If youâ€™ve had a complete exam at another facility (e.g., doctor or nurse practitioner at home, Planned Parenthood, public health clinic) in the last 10 months, you may request that copies of these records be sent to our Womenâ€™s Health Clinic as verification. That exam should include a pelvic and breast exam, pap smear, and STI test results if performed. Original prescriptions for hormonal methods from outside care providers cannot be filled at the Student Health Prescription Supply Store. See Announcements to the right for requesting records to and from SHS.  Contraception For initial use, or restarting of Birth Control Pills, Shots, Patches, Rings, implants or IUDs: A complete gynecologic history and pelvic examination is suggested prior to starting all hormonal methods of birth control: Oral contraceptives (The Pill), Depo-ProveraÂ® (The Shot), Ortho EvraÂ® (The Patch), NuvaRingÂ® (The Ring), NexplanonÂ® (implant) or an IUD. If you have never been evaluated by our Womenâ€™s Health Clinic for a routine examination, it can take 3-4 weeks to schedule this appointment. We do routinely have patients who are starting hormones for the first time in their life return for a three month â€œhormone checkâ€ counseling session prior to receiving a hormone prescription for the remainder of the year. You should call for this appointment at least two weeks prior to ending the last month supply of your hormone.  We do have a limited brand of birth control pills at the clinic rate, as well as Depo-Provera and Ortho Evra. For questions regarding pricing, please call the Womenâ€™s Health Clinic (302-831-8035).  Emergency Contraception Emergency Contraception is available over the counter without a prescription. EC can be purchased at a local pharmacy or at our Student Health Dispensary (see hours linked above). EC is most effective if taken within 72 hours, but can be taken out to 120 hours from unprotected intercourse.  HPV Vaccine The HPV (Human Papillomavirus) Vaccine is available through our Immunization Clinic, and can be billed through your insurance.  Pregnancy Testing and Counseling Non-directive counseling appointments are available regarding all pregnancy options and alternatives. Make an appointment to verify pregnancy if you have missed a period, and come prepared to provide a first morning urine sample.  STD Screening and Counseling and other Gynecological Problems Patients with urgent problems will be seen as soon as possible, but please call in advance (302-831-8035) to speak with the triage nurse so we can determine how best to meet your needs. If you are uncomfortable or very worried, we always try to arrange for you to be seen the same day you call, but it is not always possible. There may be a several day wait for less urgent problems.  Patients who would like to schedule for just a routine STD screen can call or can make an appointment online using our secure portal (linked on the right under Announcements). Please schedule when you would not be bleeding and at least two weeks from possible exposure.  Patients who suspect they have a simple urinary tract infection without vaginal symptoms can also elect to be evaluated in our main Medical Clinic.  Sexually Transmitted Disease and Vaginitis Treatment In addition to screening and counseling, evaluations are also available for Yeast Vaginitis, Bacterial Vaginosis, Herpes, Genital Warts, and other dermatological problems. Available testing includes: â€“ Gonorrhea/Chlamydia testing â€“ Syphilis Blood work â€“ Herpes Viral Culture when medically indicated â€“ Thin Prep Pap Smears with HPV testing as medically indicated â€“ HIV counseling and testing referrals  Ideally, STD testing after a possible exposure should be done at least two weeks later, and not during a womanâ€™s period. Call or use our web portal using the links at the top of this site to make an appointment.  If a woman believes she has a yeast infection, over-the-counter anti-fungal medication is available at our Dispensary without a prescription. If you have never been diagnosed with a yeast infection before, we do still encourage a patient to be examined first for correct diagnosis. It is helpful for us when evaluating a patient for vaginal symptoms if the patient has not used any anti-fungal vaginal medication for at least 24 hours.

There are many opportunities for emotional growth at a university, but not everyone makes it through college without experiencing some challenges along the way. It is recommended that students seek help if these difficulties are interfering with their academic or personal well-being. Our Counseling and Psychological Service (CAPS) team works together with other providers at Student Health Services to assist students in getting their emotional needs met. These include conflicts with or worry about friends or family, concerns about eating or drinking patterns and feelings of anxiety and depression. Although some concerns are more frequent than others, students' experiences are as varied as the students themselves. Staff members help each person to figure out her or his own situation, through individual, group and couplesâ€™ counseling, crisis counseling and referrals. FIU has psychiatrists, social workers and psychologists who are available by referral from either Counseling and Psychological Services or primary care clinicians within Student Health Services. Our psychiatrists provide evaluations and, if indicated, medication and short-term supportive psychotherapy.

Sexual Health is a state of physical, mental, and social well-being in relation to
            sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction, or infirmity. Sexual
            health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships,
            as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free
            of coercion, discrimination, and violence.  For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons
               must be respected, protected, and fulfilled.  Sexual Health and Gynecology at Student Health Services offers confidential examinations,
            testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), contraceptives management, and
            additional gynecological services. Call (813) 974-2331 or click here to make an appointment. PLEASE NOTE: STI testing is available at student rates. Ask
            about free STI testing in collaboration with our community partners.  CONTRACEPTIVES  In addition, Student Health Services offers a wide range of contraceptive services
               to include:   Contraceptive counseling  Free Condoms  Prescriptions for birth control pills, rings or patches  Placement of IUDs and Long Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC)  Contraceptive implants  Emergency Contraception  Birth Control Injections   For more information on these methods visit:  Birth Control: Planned Parenthood  Contraceptive options and other topics: Bedsider  Sexual Health and You: I wanna know!

Patients are seenÂ primarily by appointment and are encouraged to make appointments for annual examinations at least two weeks in advance.  Procedures Performed by Health Services Providers:   Annual Exams  Pap Smears  Contraceptive Management  Pregnancy Testing  IUD Insertion and Removal â€“ Click here for more information  Nexplanon Insertion and Removal â€“ Click here for more information  Sexually Transmitted Infection Testing (STI Testing)  Depo-Provera Injections  Other Gynecological concerns   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recently came out with new Pap smear guidelines:   Women should have their first screening Pap smear at age 21 unless the women has had a previous abnormal Pap smear.  Women in their 20â€™s should have a Pap smear every three years (assuming prior Pap smears have been normal).  Women age 30 and older who have had three consecutive normal Pap smears should have a Pap smear every three years.  Women who have had a hysterectomy for non-cancerous reasons do not need a Pap smear unless they have a cervix.  These guidelines need to be followed whether you have or have not had the HPV vaccine.  Georgia Southern Health Services response to the new recommendations:  We still recommend a yearly physical including a breast exam, pelvic exam*, and STI screening if indicated.  If you have ever had an abnormal Pap smear, consult with your Health Services physician or nurse practitionerÂ concerning how often you will need a Pap smear.   *The pelvic exam may or may not include a Pap smear based on your history and the ACOG guidelines. Your physician or nurseÂ practitioner will discuss this with you at the time of your appointment.  Information Regarding an Appointment in the Womenâ€™s Health Clinic   A vaginal exam, if indicated, may not be performed if you are on your menstrual cycle. If you are on your menstrual cycle, your appointment may be rescheduled.  You may be asked to submit a urine specimen at your examination visit for evaluation of specific symptoms.  Drinking water will keep you hydrated. Staying hydrated will make it easier for the lab personnel to access a vein if it is necessary to draw your blood for testing.  Do NOT use any vaginal creams or douche for two (2) days prior to your examination because it will interfere with your test results if a vaginal exam is indicated.  Do NOT have sexual intercourse for two (2) days prior to your examination because it will interfere with your test results if a vaginal exam is indicated.  Write down any questions you may have so you can discuss them with your provider at the time of your examination.    Prescription Refill requests:  In order to serve you more efficiently, if you require a refill on a medication prescribed for you by one of our providers, please contact the pharmacy where you filled the script to initiate the refill request electronically; or, you may send your provider a secure message in Online Student Health to request the refill.Â  Health Services providers do not accept telephoned refill requests.

Immunization Records       Getting Started on Birth Control  All women requesting birth control will need to be seen by a provider. Women who have had a recent pap smear should have a copy of the results in their record. Student Health Clinic providers will assist women in making a choice on the birth control that is right for them. The Student Health Clinic offers a variety of birth control methods. In the form of pills, the following are offered: Mircette, Orthonovum, Orthotricyclen and Trivora. The Student Health Clinic also offers the patch (Ortho Evra), the Nuvra Ring and the shot (Depro-Provera).        Contraceptive Management   The Student Health Clinic has many contraceptive options available to women. Whatever form of birth control a woman decides to use, her provider will discuss the benefits and risks of each birth control method.  Starting Contraception The clinical staff will advise women on how to start contraception and answer any questions during the clinic appointment. Women who have any additional questions regarding the use of birth control may call the clinician on staff at 404-413-1930.  Forms of Birth Control Provided by the Student Health Clinic: Birth Control Pill The Ring The Shot Plan B Birth Control Pills The most common method of birth control is oral contraception. The Student Health Clinic has the combination pills. They are made of estrogen and progesterone and work by preventing the women's ovaries from releasing eggs. Taking the pill daily keeps a level of hormone that is needed to prevent pregnancy. The pill is one of the most effective means of birth control.   The Ring The Nuva Ring is a small flexible ring that is changed once a month. The ring has both estrogen and progesterone to protect against pregnancy.   The Shot Depo-Provera is an injectable progesterone-only method of birth control. One shot of Depo-Provera will prevent pregnancy for 12 weeks.   Emergency Contraceptive Pills (Plan B) Plan B is available for women who have had unprotected sex within the last 72 to 120 hours. It can prevent pregnancy after having a contraception failure. The sooner Plan B is taken, the more effective it is. Plan B is Levonorgestrel 0.75mg. It prevents fertilization and implantation. It will not work once implantation has begun. Plan B is not the abortion pill. It will not work if a woman is already pregnant . Women can obtain Plan B by making a nurse visit. The Student Health Clinic offers counseling for women who have had unprotected sex and are concerned about pregnancy.    Refills of Birth Control Women have two choices when having birth control refilled. First, a prescription for birth control can be provided and filled at a local pharmacy. If a woman has private insurance, this may be the best option. Second, birth control can be dispensed at the clinic. Women will need to come in or call the office to request a medication refill and will need to provide their student number and the name of the medication to be refilled to the receptionist. Medication will be available to pick up at the clinic in 24 hours.  Women will need to provide a copy of their recent Pap smear and medical record with documentation of the last Depo-Provera injection given in order to request a refill of Depo-Provera if the Student Health Clinic has not ordered this for them previously.

Methods includes pills, patches, rings, IUDs and implants. Check your coverage to see which brands are  free.  Women without insurance- generic OrthoCyclen, and Tri-Cyclen are available at WalMart , Target and Kroger for $9 per pack/$24 for 3 packs. Kroger has Trinessa and Sprintec; Walmart has Tri-Sprintec and Sprintec.  The method of contraception you choose should fit your needs and your lifestyle.  Always be responsible for your own contraceptive and std prevention methodsâ€”do not rely on your partner! Most methods of contraception are reversible. Read the ""Options from your healthcare provider"" section below the PAP guidelines to learn about different types of contraception.  How to get birth control through the clinic  Meet with the Administrator to determine if you qualify for financial assistance before making an appointment . The clinic carries a few brands for uninsured students who qualify for financial assistance. Ortho Tri Cyclen (generic), Aubra (low estrogen-generic for Alesse, Aviane and Sronyx), Reclipsen (generic-as close to Yasmin as possible) Emoquette
    (at the Campus Center clinc) and the Depo shot.  Insured students will be given a written prescription to fill at the pharmacy of your choice.    PAP Guidelines  Pap guidelines  are age-based. Guidelines emphasize detection of sexually transmitted infections. IUPUI Campus Health will screen women for sexually transmitted infections at annual visits for bcp refill and initiation.   Females 21-29 or older with a history of normal paps need one every 3 years.  Females  30 years of age or older with normal results for the last 3 consecutive smears need a pap every 3-5  years. If HPV testing is done with the pap, the schedule is every 5 years.   If you have had a pap done by another provider, please bring a copy of the report.  If you don't bring a copy, you will be asked to sign a release of information so we can obtain a copy.  Routine Contraception  Routine contraception includes those methods that you have planned ahead to use.    Rerversible contraception methods that require a prescription include: a variety of birth control pills, a vaginal ring, the Depo shot, the Ortho Evra patch, Implanon-an under the skin implant, and an intrauterine device (IUD). The IUPUI Health Center prescribes birth control pills,rings and patches. A Gyn referral will be made for diaphrams, Implanon and IUDs.  Options from your healthcare provider  The following routine contraception methods are available only through prescription, administration, or a procedure by your healthcare provider.   Birth Control Pill - Birth control pills prevent spikes in a couple of hormones to prevent ovulation.  BCPs use synthetic hormones (similar to the estrogen and progesterone made in a womanâ€™s body) to prevent the ovaries from releasing an egg. The amount and type of  estrogens and progesterones vary.  Birth control pills are 92-99.7% effective in preventing pregnancy; but they do not prevent STDs . It is important to use a barrier method in addition to the pill to prevent stds.  The range in effectiveness depends on how consistently they are taken. See the package insert to see what to do if you forget one or more pills.    No more than a 4 hour variance is recommended for low estrogen pills (Ortho Tri-Cyclen lo, Alesse, Aviane, or Loestrin etc).  Side effects , such as irregular bleeding, weight changes, or nausea; more serious side effects such as blood clots, gall stones,  and hypertension.  Women who are 35 or older and/or who smoke are at greatest risk.  Some side effects of BCPs are helpful: light periods, meaning lighter flow, fewer days of bleeding, and less cramping. Some  clear up acne. They  regulate your cycle so you can predict when your period will occur.  Types -There are 2 basic types of bcps. Monophasic- each active pill contains the same amount of hormones and triphasic ,   the amount of progesterone varies. Examples are Tri-Sprintec, TriPrevifem, and OrthoTri-Cyclen . The last week of a monophasic pill pack contains no hormones. These pills are a different color. That week of pills is included simply to maintain the habit of taking a pill. They do not need to be taken. If you skip them, you must remember to begin taking the active pills after  7 days of not taking any pills.   Some  birth control pills have fewer placebo pills which decreases the length or number of periods. Seasonale contains 84 active pills. Women taking this pill have only 4 periods per year. Some women will have unplanned spotting until their body becomes accomstomed to the schedule. Another brand, Seasonique , has 84 pills with usual hormones levels and 7 with less estrogen (no inactive pills). The week of low hormone pills decreases spotting. The benefit of skipping inactive pills is fewer or lighter periods. Skipping the week of inactive pills will delay your next period. Spotting may occur due to the changed hormone levels. The number of inactive pills that are taken each month may be gradually decreased to avoid spotting. The clinic handout provides information about when to start pills, what to do for missed pills etc.  The manufacturer's insert is very helpful in answering questions about BCPs also. Some pills include iron (FE) in the last week of pills.   Birth Control Patch - The Ortho Evra patch is a thin hormone-coated adhesive patch which is placed on your skin (free of lotions, creams and sweat) of the upper arm, buttocks, stomach, or upper torso.  The patch remains in place for one week, and then is replaced by a new patch.  After three weeks of wearing a patch, the woman goes without a patch and has a period. The patch is up to 99.7% effective in preventing pregnancy  because women forget pills. Patches have a higher risk for stroke .    Vaginal Ring - Like the pill and the patch, the Nuva Ring (a prescription brand), uses synthetic hormones similar to estrogen and progesterone to prevent the ovaries from releasing an egg.  To use, a small, flexible ring is inserted deep into the vagina for three weeks and is taken out for the fourth week.  The ring is up to 99.7% effective in preventing pregnancy when used correctly; but it is not effective in protecting against stds so a barrier method should also be used (diaphragms, caps, and shields cannot be used with the ring).  The side effects of the vaginal ring are similar to those of the patch and the pill (with special concerns for women who are age 35 or older and/or women who are smokers).  Additional side effects might include increased vaginal discharge and vaginal irritation or infection.    Injection - The injection (shot) Depo method of birth control uses a progesterone-only hormone to prevent the ovaries from releasing an egg or, sometimes, to thicken the cervical mucus to prevent the joining of sperm and egg.  Using this method requires visits to your healthcare provider every 12-13 weeks for an injection.  The shot is 97-99.7% effective in preventing pregnancy; but it does not protect against STDs so use of a barrier method is recommended.  Side effects might include weight changes, depression, skin rash, headache, dizziness, and others that might last 12 weeks until an injection wears off.  An increased risk of osteoporosis has been linked to use of the injection method but appears to be reversed once the Depo shot is discontinued. Return of fertility can take up to 18 months after the last injection.    Implants - Implanon is a non-estrogen hormone which is effective for up to 3 years. This method involves the implantation of a small rod in the upper arm by a trained healthcare provider.  The rods continuously releases synthetic hormones similar to estrogen and progesterone.  Implants are 99.95% effective in preventing pregnancy.    IUD - The IUD (intrauterine device) is a small T-shaped device that is placed in the uterusr.  There are two types of IUDsâ€”one releases hormones (levonorgestrel, a form of progestin, is effective for 5 years) and the other uses copper (which is toxic to sperm; effective for 10 years) as a means of contraception.  Both types of IUD prevent implantation of the egg into the lining of the uterus.  The IUD is 99.4-99.9% effective in preventing pregnancy.    Diaphragm, Cap, and Shield - The diaphragm is a shallow latex cup that fits into your vagina and is 84-94% effective at preventing pregnancy.  The cervical cap is a silicone cup shaped like a sailorâ€™s hat that fits into the vagina and is about 86% effective in preventing pregnancy in women who have never been pregnant or who have never given birth vaginally. It is about 71% effective in preventing pregnancy in women who have given birth vaginally. (After childbirth, the cervical opening is larger). The shield is a silicone cup with an air valve to the vagina and is about 85% effective in preventing pregnancy.    Permanent Methods - Vasectomies for men and tubal ligation or tubal implants (ESSURE) are permanent methods of birth control.  A vasectomy or tubal ligation may sometimes be reversed. Essure is a  a spring-shaped wire inserted into the fallopian tube via the uterus.  These methods are recommended for men/women who are sure they do not want any or anymore children.   Options that do not require a visit to your healthcare provider  Non-prescription methods such as emergency contraception, withdrawal, condoms, sponges, spermacides, and fertility awareness (natural family planning) are available without prescriptions..  Not all are very reliable methods but are commonly used. Some of the following contraception options are available for over-the-counter purchase at drug stores, grocery stores, discount stores, etc.   Withdrawal - The withdrawal method of contraception involves the man pulling his penis out of the vagina before ejaculation.  Withdrawal is not a recommended method of contraception because it requires self-control and experience. It is not for men who ejaculate prematurely.  Men release a pre-ejaculate fluid that contains sperm, so pregnancy is still possible.  Withdrawal  can be 73-96% effective in preventing pregnancy, but the effectiveness is highly dependant on the situation and the couple.  Withdrawal does not protect against stds.  Use of a condom is recommended.  With a condom, withdrawal can be nearly 100% effective in preventing pregnancy.    Male Condom - The male condom is a sheath-like piece of latex or sheepskin that fits over an erect penis to prevent the exchange of body fluids during sexual intercourse.  When used properly, the condom is 85-98% effective; helping to prevent pregnancy and the transfer of stds.  Be sure to follow the package instructions carefully for the most effective protection.  Check the expiration date on the box before using a condomâ€”an expired condom is more likely to break, allowing the transfer of body fluids to occur.  Lubricant is also useful to prevent breakage. Planned Parenthood provides instructions for the correct use of a condom. Read package instructions carefully for information specific to the brand. FREE condoms are available at both clinics .    Female Condom - The female condom is a barrier method of contraception that the woman can insert into her vagina up to eight hours before sexual intercourse.  The double-ringed polyurethane female condom is 79-95% effective in protecting against pregnancy and stds when used properly.  Be sure to follow the package instructions carefully for the most effective protection; and because insertion can be tricky, it might be helpful to practice inserting a female condom a few times before you attempt to use one during intercourse.  The female condom can help the woman take responsibility for contraception.    Emergency Contraception - There are times when the need for emergency contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy arises.  If your method of routine birth control fails (a condom breaks, for example, or you havenâ€™t taken your birth control pills properly), if you had unprotected sex, or if you have been sexually assaulted, seeking emergency contraception should be at the top of your priority list. Emergency contracepton is not fail-proof and does not protect against stds. It is most effective if used within 72 hours but may be used up to 120 hours after sex.Use of  ECP reduces the risk of pregnancy after unprotected intercourse by 75%-89%. Two brands of emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) are available without prescription for women age 18 and older.  These pills contain progestin-only, no estrogen. Brand names are Plan B and NextChoice.  Speak to the pharmacist to obtain ECP. Progestin-only ECPs  contain only the hormone progestin.  In the United, States, these pills are sold without a prescription for women 18 years of age and older. Plan B must be requested from the pharmacist; it is not out on the shelves. The risk of nausea and vomiting is lower with progestin-only ECPs.  Several types of prescription birth control pills can be used for emergency contraception. See not-2-late.com for names and doses.  More pills than usual must be taken. Most birth control pills contain estrogen and progesterone.  
    	  About 50% of women who use regular birth control pills as emergency contraception will become nauseated and 20% will vomit due to the amount of estrogen.    Sponge - Today is a barrier method that returned to the U.S. market in 2005 after a 10-year absence. It is a soft, disk-shaped device with a loop for removal. It is made out of polyurethane foam and contains the spermicide nonoxynol-9 (which may cause vaginal irritation). The sponge is 84-91% effect in preventing pregnancy in women who have not had a child and 68-91% effective in preventing pregnancy in women who have had a child. The sponge is effective for more than one act of intercourse for up to 24 hours, and it needs to be left in for at least six hours after intercourse to prevent pregnancy. There is a risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome if the sponge is left in for more than 30 hours. The sponge does not protect against STDs , so use of a male condom is also recommended. There is only one brand of contraceptive sponge available in the U.S. â€“ the Today Sponge, and it can be purchased in drug stores and other pharmacies. Be sure to follow the package instructions carefully for the most effective protection against pregnancy.    Spermicide - Spermicide can be in the form of a foam, cream, jelly, film, or suppository that is inserted into the vagina before intercourse to immobilize sperm and keep them from penetrating the egg.  Some male condoms are also lubricated with spermicide.  While spermicides are 71-85% effective in preventing pregnancy, they are not effective in protecting against STDs .  Spermicides can be used as backup contraception with birth control pills, condoms, IUDs, and other methods.  Spermicides with nonoxynol-9 may cause vaginal or rectal irritation: this irritation increases the risk of acquiring stds (including HIV transmission if your partner is infected with HIV).    Fertility Awareness - Fertility awareness methods of birth control involve carefully monitoring the woman's menstrual cycle to determine which days the woman is most/least fertile so that she can avoid intercourse on fertile days.  This may involve daily monitoring of body temperature (kits available in drugstores) and cervical mucus consistency, careful and accurate recording of the menstrual cycle on the calendar, or keeping track of the menstrual cycle with CycleBeads (color-coded beads to help a woman determine her fertile days based on the start of her period).  The fertility awareness method of contraception can be 75-99% effective depending on the woman's dedication to the daily record-keeping and observation that this method requires; but it is not effective in preventing transmission of STDs .  Family planning centers and places of worship frequently offer classes on fertility awareness.     With so many varieties, it is important to consider factors that are important to your lifestyle. Those factors may include cost, reliability, frequency of use, length of use, reversability and risks.

Talk with a Health and Wellness educator about your health, lifestyle, and what methods are right for you. We can help you learn about: Oral contraceptives, or birth control pills Barrier contraception, including condoms and diaphragms Emergency contraception (the ""morning after"" pill) Depo-Provera , long-term birth control by injection Many other options Some forms of birth control require a prescription or medical exam. You can get expert gynecological care at the IU Health Center Women's Clinic . Pregnancy Testing The first sign of a pregnancy is usually a missed period. A simple urine test can determine whether or not you are pregnant. The Health Center Pharmacy has pregnancy test kits available for purchase at a low price. If you are pregnant, IU Health Center can help you get the medical care you need. You can also talk with one of our Health and Wellness educators for help coping with an unexpected pregnancy. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) STIs are transmitted through intimate contact with a partner's genital area, including the labia and vagina, penis and scrotum, and anal region. Symptoms tend to appear first in the genital area, though you can also get STIs in your mouth or throat after engaging in oral sexual contact. Some STIs don't show any symptoms at all. If you experience any unusual discharge, lump, pain or discomfort in the breasts, vagina, vulva, penis, or testicles, you should see a medical professional as soon as possible. Schedule an appointment at IU Health Center through MyHealth or call (812) 855-7688. If you infect a partner, he or she can also be treated at the IU Health Center whether or not your partner is an IU Bloomington student. The only sure way to avoid STIs is by abstaining from all sexual activity. There are some things you can do to reduce your risk: Mutual monogamy with your romantic partner Condoms, even if you are using another form of birth control Vaccinations for human papilloma virus (HPV) and Hepatitis B, available through the IU Health Center medical clinic Visual inspection of your partner's genitals for changes in texture, lumps, color, odor or discharge. If you notice a change, avoid sexual contact until the affected person has been checked out by a medical professional. Follow treatment directions, including taking your entire prescription even after symptoms disappear. You should also avoid sexual contact until treatment is complete. Communication with your partners, including your sexual history Be aware that spermicides can increase your risk of infection because they can irritate the mucous membrances in the vagina. Healthy Sexual Relationships Sex should be an important and fulfilling part of your life. Talk to a Health and Wellness educator if you have concerns about: Communicating with your partner Having more fulfilling sexual experiences How to give and understand sexual consent Sexual orientation Your visit is completely confidential.

Emergency contraception (EC) is birth control that prevents pregnancy after sexual intercourse, which is why it is sometimes called â€œthe morning after pill.â€ You can use emergency contraception right away - or up to three days (72 hours) after intercourse- if you think your birth control might have failed due to missed doses of birth control pills, you didnâ€™t use contraception, or you were forced to have sex. EC makes it much less likely you will get pregnant. If taken within 3 days of unprotected intercourse, EC reduces the chance of pregnancy by up to 89%. The sooner you take it, the more effective it will be. ECÂ  is not as effective as birth control thatâ€™s used during sex, like the pill, Nuva Ring, Depo shot, Mirena, Implanon, or condoms. So if you are sexually active or planning to be, donâ€™t use emergency contraception as your only protection against pregnancy.Â  EC does not protect against sexually transmitted infections, including HIV (only condoms do).  University Health and Counseling Services offers EC in the form of EContra EZ, one pill containing Levonorgestrel, a hormone found in many birth control pills. EContra EZ contains a much higher dose of Levonorgestrel and without the addition of estrogen.Â  Please call or come in to purchase EC over the counter if you need it!

Missouri law tuberculosis screening/testing requirement  Why do I have to do this?  Missouri Law (RS 199.290) requires the following:Â  All institutions of higher education in Missouri shall implement a targeted testing program on their campuses for all on-campus students and faculty upon matriculation. Any entering student of an institution of higher education in Missouri who does not comply with the targeted testing program shall not be permitted to maintain enrollment in the subsequent semester at such institution.  Who is required to do this?  STUDENTS: Those who are newly enrolled or returning after more than a one semester break.Â  Students must complete the requirement before registering for the second semester following the initial semester triggering the requirement of the university.  FACULTY: All new full-time faculty and per-course faculty at Missouri State University.  What do I need to do?   You must complete a simple short online survey about possible tuberculosis exposure. The survey is accessed through My Missouri State . Select the Campus LifeÂ Tab and click the ""Tuberculosis Screening Survey"" link under the Wellness heading. For most, completing the survey will fulfill the requirement and no further action will be required.  If a tuberculosis exposure risk factor is indicated on the survey, tuberculosis testing and further screening is required. The test will consist of a blood sample or a skin test. Testing may be completed at MagersÂ Health and Wellness Center on campus or by another qualified provider.  Call 417-836-4000 to schedule an appointment at MagersÂ Health and Wellness Center for testing and further screening.  If testing is completed by another provider, the results must be provided to the MagersÂ Health and Wellness Center Treatment Nurse for review for the following required components: Date administered, date of reading, millimeters of induration, and signature of qualified health care provider. Outside test results may be faxed to Attention: Treatment Nurse at 417-837-3020. Those providing outside results must make an appointment to visit or call the MagersÂ Health and Wellness Center Treatment Nurse at 417-836-4020 to complete the additional screening.Â There is no cost for this screening encounter.    If the initial test is positive, further testing and evaluation will be needed before the requirement is met.   Where can I get more information about tuberculosis and risk factors?  View our TB Screening/Testing Information for New Students page for more information.  Whom do I contact if I have more questions about this?

We provide two kinds of Emergency Contraception (EC) that are available at our Pharmacy for $25-$30. We provide the lowest cost in the area for emergency contraception.  What is emergency contraception (EC)?  EC is birth control used AFTER intercourse to prevent pregnancy. It can be provided through oral medication (pills) or insertion of an IUD (intrauterine device). Use of EC is a safe and effective way of reducing the risk of pregnancy after unprotected sex (condom failure, missed oral contraceptive (OC), or failure to use a contraceptive method, etc.).  Formerly referred to as the â€œmorning after pillâ€ EC pills areÂ intended as emergency contraception. If you have a need for ongoing contraception please discuss this with a clinician at Health & Wellness.  EC isÂ not the abortion pill (RU486). EC is not effective after pregnancy has occurred and cannot interrupt it.  How do emergency contraception pills work?  EC pills createÂ a short strong burst of hormones which interfere with the normal hormone patterns of the menstrual cycle. They work by delaying the release of an egg from the ovary.Â  It is also possible that they, interfere with sperm swimming in cervical mucus, disturb the lining of the uterus to prevent implantation in the uterus, or interfere with the transportation of the egg or sperm through the fallopian tubes.  What types of emergency contraception are available at Health & Wellness Pharmacy?  There are two types of emergency contraception pills thatÂ are available through the HS Pharmacy.  Non-presciption  PLAN B,Â Next Choice, One Step, and Levonorgestrel (generic)  Approved for use up to 5 days after unprotected sex  Most effective if taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex  Decreasing effectiveness with time after unprotected sex  Most effective for women with a BMI of less than 26  Low cost  Prescription  Ella  Approved for use up to 5 days after unprotected sex  Equally effective for all 5 days  No loss of effectiveness up to at least a BMI of 30  Low cost  If you choose ella, you will be asked to complete a short questionnaire which will be reviewed by one of our clinicians.Â  After review, the clinician will determine which EC is appropriate for you or you may be asked to make an appointment if additional information is needed.    Is there a risk I could become pregnant after using emergency contraception?  The risk of becoming pregnant with any single act of intercourse can be as high as 30%. Pregnancy rates are less than 4% after use of emergency contraception. With levonorgestrel (e.g. Plan B), if it turns outÂ you are already pregnant, there is no effect on the pregnancy.Â  Ellaâ€™s effect on pregnancy has not been tested.Â  If there is any chance you might be pregnant, donâ€™t take ella.Â Â Using EC will not affect a woman's ability to become pregnant in the future.  Are there contraindications?  There are very few contraindications to using EC. These contraindications include existing pregnancy, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, or allergy to the ingredients of the pills.  How is emergency contraception used?  One tablet of EC is taken within 120 hours of unprotected sex. Plan B is mostÂ effective if it is taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex.Â  Ellaâ€™s effectiveness remains constant for all 5 days after unprotected sex.  What are the common side effects of emergency contraception?  Common side effects that will subside within a few days include:  Headache  Fluid retention  Breast tenderness  Irregular bleeding  Nausea  Mild abdominal pain  Menstrual changes may occur during the cycle in which EC is used. These include spotting and/or a period may be earlier or later than expected.  Health & Wellness Can Help You  Contact us if you experience any of the following after taking EC  Vomit within 2 hours of taking your dose of EC (this is very unlikely). This dose must be repeated. There is medication available to help prevent vomiting.  No menses within three weeks of taking EC. You should have a pregnancy test.  Have a very unusual period.  Questions  You can make an appointment to see a Health & Wellness clinical provider if you have any additional questions or concerns:  (603) 862-1094Â to talk with a pharmacist  (603) 862-2856Â to talk with a nurse   It may be helpful to have a dose of ECP on hand.Â  Your medical provider or pharmacist can provide ECP before it is needed.

Non-presciption  PLAN B,Â Next Choice, One Step, and Levonorgestrel (generic)  Approved for use up to 5 days after unprotected sex  Most effective if taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex  Decreasing effectiveness with time after unprotected sex  Most effective for women with a BMI of less than 26  Low cost  Prescription  Ella  Approved for use up to 5 days after unprotected sex  Equally effective for all 5 days  No loss of effectiveness up to at least a BMI of 30  Low cost  If you choose ella, you will be asked to complete a short questionnaire which will be reviewed by one of our clinicians.Â  After review, the clinician will determine which EC is appropriate for you or you may be asked to make an appointment if additional information is needed.    Is there a risk I could become pregnant after using emergency contraception?  The risk of becoming pregnant with any single act of intercourse can be as high as 30%. Pregnancy rates are less than 4% after use of emergency contraception. With levonorgestrel (e.g. Plan B), if it turns outÂ you are already pregnant, there is no effect on the pregnancy.Â  Ellaâ€™s effect on pregnancy has not been tested.Â  If there is any chance you might be pregnant, donâ€™t take ella.Â Â Using EC will not affect a woman's ability to become pregnant in the future.  Are there contraindications?  There are very few contraindications to using EC. These contraindications include existing pregnancy, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, or allergy to the ingredients of the pills.  How is emergency contraception used?  One tablet of EC is taken within 120 hours of unprotected sex. Plan B is mostÂ effective if it is taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex.Â  Ellaâ€™s effectiveness remains constant for all 5 days after unprotected sex.  What are the common side effects of emergency contraception?  Common side effects that will subside within a few days include:  Headache  Fluid retention  Breast tenderness  Irregular bleeding  Nausea  Mild abdominal pain  Menstrual changes may occur during the cycle in which EC is used. These include spotting and/or a period may be earlier or later than expected.  Health & Wellness Can Help You  Contact us if you experience any of the following after taking EC  Vomit within 2 hours of taking your dose of EC (this is very unlikely). This dose must be repeated. There is medication available to help prevent vomiting.  No menses within three weeks of taking EC. You should have a pregnancy test.  Have a very unusual period.

Every month, your body prepares for pregnancy. If no pregnancy occurs, the uterus sheds its lining. The menstrual blood is partly blood and partly tissue from inside the uterus, or womb. It passes out of the body through the vagina. Periods usually start around age 12 and continue until menopause, at about age 51. Most periods last from three to five days.  â€¢ Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) 1-10 days before your period, you might feel bloated or have diarrhea, nausea, backache, tender breasts or cramping. You might notice mood changes such as irritability, depression and decreased coping skills. These common symptoms are called premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Some women have all of these symptoms every cycle; some never have any. Most have some symptoms with some cycles.  What you can do to relieve PMS symptoms: â€¢ Cut down on salt and refined sugar â€¢ Avoid caffeine â€¢ Get regular exercise â€¢ See your health provider if symptoms are severe  What you can do to relieve cramps: â€¢ You might get muscle cramps the first few days of your period. These can be dull, achy pains in your abdomen, or they can be sharp and severe. â€¢ Rest with a heating pad on your abdomen â€¢ Take an over-the-counter pain reliever â€¢ Regular exercise can help prevent cramps â€¢ See your health care provider if they are severe and persistent  â€¢ See a health care provider every year for a gynecological exam [link]. If you have vaginal changes such as pain, burning or itching; develop sores; have abnormal discharge, such as a bad odor or yellow or greenish in color; have more discharge than usual  For more information about sexual health, ask your health care provider or visit the following websites: Go Ask Alice (Columbia University): http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/ WebMD: http://www.webmd.com  Pelvic Exam  You should also get a yearly pelvic exam, performed by a gynecologist, family doctor, or a nurse practitioner.  Pregnancy prevention, tests, and pregnancy and abortion services  The nurse practitioner can advise you on pregnancy prevention options, including birth control pills, diaphragms, IUDs (Intra-uterine device), etc. For a comprehensive explanation of birth control methods, go to Planned Parenthoodâ€™s website:  http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control-4211.htm  Pregnancy tests can be done at the Wellness Center. The Nurse Practitioner can provide referrals to pregnancy services, as well as pregnancy option and abortion services. Again, Planned Parenthood is an excellent resource for all of your pregnancy options.  Breast Health  It is important to perform a breast self-exam once a month. If you notice any abnormal lumps, nipple discharge, or other symptoms, visit your health care provider, or the Nurse Practitioner at the Wellness Center, immediately.  How to examine your breasts: â€¢ Lie down and place your right arm behind your head. The exam is done while lying down, not standing up. This is because when lying down the breast tissue spreads evenly over the chest wall and is as thin as possible, making it much easier to feel all the breast tissue. â€¢ Use the finger pads of the 3 middle fingers on your left hand to feel for lumps in the right breast. Use overlapping dime-sized circular motions of the finger pads to feel the breast tissue. â€¢ Use 3 different levels of pressure to feel all the breast tissue. Light pressure is needed to feel the tissue closest to the skin; medium pressure to feel a little deeper; and firm pressure to feel the tissue closest to the chest and ribs. It is normal to feel a firm ridge in the lower curve of each breast, but you should tell your doctor if you feel anything else out of the ordinary. If you're not sure how hard to press, talk with your doctor or nurse. Use each pressure level to feel the breast tissue before moving on to the next spot. â€¢ Move around the breast in an up and down pattern starting at an imaginary line drawn straight down your side from the underarm and moving across the breast to the middle of the chest bone (sternum or breastbone). Be sure to check the entire breast area going down until you feel only ribs and up to the neck or collar bone (clavicle). â€¢ There is some evidence to suggest that the up-and-down pattern (sometimes called the vertical pattern) is the most effective pattern for covering the entire breast, without missing any breast tissue. â€¢ Repeat the exam on your left breast, putting your left arm behind your head and using the finger pads of your right hand to do the exam. â€¢ While standing in front of a mirror with your hands pressing firmly down on your hips, look at your breasts for any changes of size, shape, contour, or dimpling, or redness or scaliness of the nipple or breast skin. (The pressing down on the hips position contracts the chest wall muscles and enhances any breast changes.) â€¢ Examine each underarm while sitting up or standing and with your arm only slightly raised so you can easily feel in this area. Raising your arm straight up tightens the tissue in this area and makes it harder to examine. This procedure for doing breast self exam is different from previous recommendations. These changes represent an extensive review of the medical literature and input from an expert advisory group. There is evidence that this position (lying down), the area felt, pattern of coverage of the breast, and use of different amounts of pressure increase a woman's ability to find abnormal areas.  (Source: American Cancer Society )  For an excellent video about how to perform a breast self-exam: http://video.healthination.com/hn/breast-self-exam/performing-breast-self-exam-bse.html  The Wellness Center also has free educational brochures.  In addition, women over 40 should get a mammogram once a year. A mammogram is a quick, simple, safe x-ray that checks for abnormalities.  Men's Health Care   The most important things you can do to stay healthy are: â€¢ Get recommended screening tests. â€¢ Be tobacco free. â€¢ Be physically active. â€¢ Eat a healthy diet. â€¢  Stay at a healthy weight. â€¢  Take preventive medicines if you need them.  Download or print this checklist and take it with you next time you go to see the doctor:  Click to Download â€œMen: Stay Healthy at Any Ageâ€ More info: http://www.ahrq.gov/ppip/healthymen.htm  Yearly Physical Exam (see above)  As part of your yearly physical exam, the doctor or nurse practitioner  will exam your penis, scrotum, and testicles for any abnormalities and  screen for colon cancer. Itâ€™s also important to get tested for Sexually  Transmitted Infections (STIs) so ask your health care provider if itâ€™s a  part of the regular exam and, if not, request it.  It is difficult to examine yourself for signs of colon cancer, so be  sure to make regular visits to your health care provider. Younger men  may get an infection or inflammation of the prostate called prostates.  It can be treated with antibiotics. See your health care provider if you  have any of the following symptoms: â€¢ Aching pain behind the testicles or the lower back â€¢ Painful urination â€¢ Having to urinate more often â€¢ Pain during or after sex  Sexual Health  You should perform a testicular self-exam once a month. By doing a  monthly testicular self-exam (TSE), men can learn more about their own  anatomy, including knowing what's familiar for them and what's not.  Monthly exams can help with early detection of lumps, changes in  sensation or size, aches, or other unusual symptoms in the genitals.  Testicular cancer and other conditions, when caught at an early stage,  are easier to cure (these are the same reasons monthly breast self-exams  are recommended for women). Unlike many kinds of cancer, testicular  cancer is more common in younger men, meaning men should start  performing TSEs around age 14.  Steps for doing a testicular self-exam: 1. Stand in front of a mirror and look for any changes, especially  swelling, in the appearance of your scrotum (the sac that holds the  testes). It's useful to do this immediately after a shower or bath, when  the heat of the water relaxes the scrotum. 2. Rotate each testicle between your fingers and thumbs (fingers on the underside the testicle and thumbs on the top). 3. Examine the rest of your scrotum's contents (especially the  epididymis) for any changes, particularly hard, small lumps. The  epididymis can feel like a cord or rope, and may seem like a lump at  first, however it is a normal structure; become familiar with the feel  of the epididymis so you can notice actual lumps if they appear. 4. Be on the lookout for hard lumps, masses, or nodules. Often  cancerous lumps are painless, but pain can be a symptom of cancer as  well as a number of other infections or conditions, so keep note of any  discomfort.  It's normal for one testicle to be a little larger than the other,  and it's normal for your testicles and scrotum to look a bit different  from those of your friends or male family members. The key is knowing  what's normal for you, and keeping an eye out for any changes. If you  notice pain, swelling, redness, lumps, cysts, or any abnormal changes  while doing an exam, you should visit your health care provider right  away. Urologists are the type of doctor who specialize in male genital  health, however you can begin with your regular provider and get a  referral to a urologist if necessary. Many abnormal changes could be  signs of an infection (rather than cancer), which are also important to  diagnose and treat.

HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) damages the bodyâ€™s immune system. The immune system protects the body from disease. A person with HIV can range from being very healthy to being very sick. AIDS is the stage of HIV when the immune system gets very weak. When this happens, other diseases and infections can enter the body. People can have HIV for years without getting sick.  They may look and feel healthy. They may not even know they have it. But people with HIV can pass it to their sex partners or someone they share a needle with. A pregnant woman with HIV can pass it to her baby. There is no cure for HIV or AIDS. But treatments can help people stay healthy longer. And HIV can be prevented.   You can get HIV if: â€¢ You have sex (vaginal, anal or oral) with someone who has HIV. â€¢ You share needles and works to inject drugs. â€¢ You share needles to inject vitamins or steroids or needles used for tattoos or piercing. â€¢ HIV can be passed from a mother to the fetus in her womb, or to the baby during birth or breastfeeding. A pregnant woman with HIV can take medicine to greatly reduce the babyâ€™s risk.  HIV doesnâ€™t travel in the air. It must get inside the body to infect a person.   You canâ€™t get HIV from: â€¢ Donating blood. â€¢ Casual contact such as hugging, dry kissing or sharing food. â€¢ Telephones, toilet seats, towels or eating utensils. â€¢ Tears, saliva, sweat or urine. â€¢ Mosquitos or other insects.   How Is HIV Prevented?  Anyone who has sex or shares needles with a person who has HIV can get it. If you have sex, help protect yourself by practicing safer sex: â€¢ Use a new latex condom and a water-based lubricant every time you have vaginal or anal sex. People who are allergic to latex can use plastic (polyurethane) condoms, which come in both male and female styles. â€¢ Donâ€™t use oil-based lubricants. Oils in hand lotions, massage oils, Vaseline, etc. can cause the condom to leak or break. â€¢ For oral sex on a woman, (or on a man or womanâ€™s anus) use a barrier such as a dental dam, a latex condom cut and rolled flat, or plastic food wrap. Use a new barrier each time. â€¢ For oral sex on a man use a new condom each time. â€¢ Never share sex toys. If you do share, wash them well and cover them with a new condom each time.  Come into the Wellness Center for free latex condoms (in both male and female styles), dental dams, and water-based lubricant.   What Are the Symptoms?  Many symptoms of HIV can also be symptoms of other illnesses or infections. See a doctor if any of these symptoms persist: â€¢ Unexplained weight loss greater than 10 pounds â€¢ Recurring fever and/or drenching night sweats â€¢ Unexplained tiredness â€¢ Diarrhea â€¢ Swollen glands, usually in the neck, armpits or groin â€¢ Unexplained dry cough â€¢ White spots or unusual sores on the tongue or mouth  Special Concerns for Women: â€¢ Vaginal yeast infections that donâ€™t go away through standard treatments â€¢ Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) â€¢ Genital warts â€¢ Ovarian or cervical disease â€¢ Abnormal Pap tests   Getting tested!  In addition to prevention, itâ€™s a good idea to get tested regularly. Tests are confidential. Your result is told only to you, but it is also put in your medical file, so ask who has access to this file. You can get tested at the Wellness Center. Itâ€™s a simple blood test and results arrive in a few weeks. There is a small fee for the blood work.  You can also get a FREE confidential rapid-HIV test. Itâ€™s a painless finger-stick test which produces results in just 20 minutes. The William F. Ryan Community Health Network, which has several locations in Manhattan.

If you answer ""Yes,"" does that mean you must have sexual intercourse? Many students at Geneseo--more than you think--answer the second question ""No"" for a variety of reasons. Despite common perceptions, not everyone is ""doing it"" at Geneseo. Not everyone is ready or willing to have sex. If you are thinking about having sex for the first time, some factors to consider are described below. Do You Have a Healthy Relationship? Are you in a new relationship, or one that has lasted for a long period of time? Even if you are not currently in one, have you thought about what a ""healthy and loving"" relationship would require? Here are some questions to help you enhance your expectations of such a relationship: Do you and your partner have a mutual understanding of the following terms: romance, intimacy, respect, monogamy, trust, commitment? How do these terms apply to your relationship? Have you talked about these issues with each other recently?  Can you be assertive and communicate honestly with your partner, especially about personal issues (such as expectations, past and current sexual history, and various forms of contraception including abstinence)?  Are alcohol and/or other drugs used to reduce inhibitions or lessen honest communication about desires, expectations, or emotional support between you and your partner?  Do you accept yourself, your strengths and weaknesses, your feelings, and do you tell them to your partner?  Do you measure your self-worth by what you believe and do, and not by what your partner measures your?  Do you have realistic expectations about the relationship?  How do you go about making effective decisions concerning aspects of your relationship?  After personally answering these questions, we encourage you to communicate your responses with your partner. Your personal commitment to communicate is an essential factor in establishing a healthy, loving relationship. Abstinence...A Change of Thought If you decide on abstinence, it does not mean you must abstain from sexual intimacy. There are many forms of sexual expression other than sexual intercourse. Some people choose not to have sexual intercourse (vaginal, anal or oral) for a variety of reasons. They: prefer to wait for religious or moral reasons  want to wait until there is a commitment in the relationship such as marriage  do not feel physically or emotionally ready  do not want to risk pregnancy  do not want to risk getting a sexually transmitted infection  do not feel that they have the time or energy to establish a sexual relationship  The advantages of abstaining from sexual intercourse include: no risk of pregnancy  decreased risk of STI transmission  no expense for contraception  opportunity to make a deliberate decision about when, where, and how to express your sexuality  The decision to say ""no"" is enhanced by a personal commitment and plan for how you will handle a situation in which intercourse is a possibility. An ""insurance policy"" of always having a back up method of contraception and condoms in case you decide to say ""yes, just this once."" Non-penetrative safer sex or abstinence can be fun and intimate. See ""101 Ways To Make Love Without Having Sex"" (available in the Reproductive Health Center waiting room) for some ideas. Be creative and use your imagination; sex can be pleasurable and safe at the same time. For more information on abstinence, including a discussion of oral sex and masturbation, check out the SmarterSex.org web site. Back to Top Are You Ready for Sex? The first step in taking on the responsibilities required in a sexual relationship is making sure you have established and understand your sexual values and beliefs as well as those of your partner. The following questions may help you evaluate whether you are ready for sexual intercourse. Do you feel comfortable with your present level of involvement with your partner?  What do you imagine as a possible result of having sexual intercourse with your partner? How will you feel about yourself? How will you feel about your partner?  How do you feel about your partner? Do you respect and trust your partner?  Can you discuss prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? Do you feel comfortable taking the responsibility to prevent pregnancy and STIs? Have you discussed what both of you will do if pregnancy occurs?  Do you feel pressured to have sexual intercourse?  Are you comfortable talking to your partner about your decisions?  Decide yourself what level of sexual intimacy is right for you before getting into a sexual situation. You have control over your sexuality and have the right to do only that for which you feel ready. Even if you have had sex in the past, you can decide to abstain if that is what you want to do now.  Birth Control Pills This section reviews use of birth control pills. Wait until you get your period to start taking the pills. Take your first pill the Sunday following the onset of your period. However, if you start your period on a Sunday, take your pill that day. Continue to take one pill a day approximately the same time every day; the evening is the best time. You will have your period while you are taking the last seven pills. Plan to take the pill about the same time everyday to keep a steady level of hormone in your body. If the pills are taken after a meal or at bedtime, the possibility of nausea lessens for many women. After all the pills are gone in the pack, start taking the next pack regardless of whether your period has stopped or not. If you miss one period, continue taking the pill and call the your provider. If you forget one pill, take that pill as soon as you remember it. If you forget two pills, take two pills each day for the next two days, complete the rest of the pill cycle, and useÂ another method of birth control (such as foam and condoms) during the rest of the cycle. You may experience side effects during the first one or two months you are on the pill. They are: occasional spotting, mild nausea, breast tenderness and/or enlargement, and a slight weight gain. These side effects should diminish as your body adjusts to the pill. If such side effects are troublesome for several months, be sure to tell your provider when you pick up your next cycle of pills. Mid-cycle spotting or bleeding (""breakthrough bleeding"") sometimes occurs during the first one or two months. If bleeding is heavy and troublesome for more than one day, please call your provider but DON'T STOP TAKING THE PILLS. If you take each day's pill on schedule, you are not risking pregnancy. If any of the following symptoms occur, please call your presribing provider immediately: Persistent pain or numbness or weakness in the arms or legs.  Pain in the chest or shortness of breath.  Sudden severe headaches, with or without nausea or vomiting.  Dizziness.  Fainting.  Disturbance of vision or speech.  Severe depression.  Yellowing of the skin or eyes.  If any other medication is prescribed for you, please tell the medical provider that you are taking birth control pills. It has been discovered that some medications can lower the effectiveness of oral contraceptives and that oral contraceptives can lower the effectiveness of some medications. Cigarette smoking while using oral contraceptives is strongly discouraged. The nicotine and estrogen combine to increase the risks of cardiovascular problems such as stroke, heart attack and blood clots. Back to Top  Condoms and Spermicides What are Condoms and Spermicides? A condom, also called a prophylactic or ""rubber"", is a thin sheath that fit snugly over an erect penis to act as a barrier. The closed end of the condom catches the semen, so that it cannot pass into your partner at the time of ejaculation. There are many types of condoms available: latex rubber, polyurethane, lambskin, lubricated, and spermicidal. Most condoms sold in the U.S. are latex condoms which come in a variety of textures and colors. Latex and polyurethane condoms are the only condoms which prevent transmission of HIV. A spermicide is a chemical that is inserted into the vagina prior to intercourse to kill sperm and act as a barrier to the cervix. Spermicides are available in the form of foam (most effective), films, creams, jellies, and suppositories. How Effective are Condoms and Spermicides?     Theoretical Effectiveness*    Actual Effectiveness**    Condom without Spermicide    97%    86%    Condom with Spermicide    94%    74%    *Theoretical effectiveness rates are based on studies that have been done to determine how effective a method itself can be, apart from user behaviors. **Actual effectiveness rates reflect what happens to the pregnancy rate in a group of people who do not use this method correctly some of the time and who do not use this method every time they have intercourse.  Using latex condoms and a separate vaginal spermicide is more effective in preventing pregnancy than using a spermicidal condom, which does not contain as high a concentration of spermicide as a vaginal foams or film.  How to Use Condoms  Condoms must be used correctly in order to be effective. Condoms are packaged individually. In order to maintain their effectiveness, they must be protected from heat, so avoid storing condoms in car glove compartments and similar areas.  Putting It On Before any sexual contact, when the penis is erect:  Pinch the condom at the tip and squeeze out any air.    Place the rolled-up condom against the end of the erect penis.      Unroll the condom to cover the entire penis.      If you put it on backwards and it does not unroll easily, don't flip it over; there may be semen on it. Use another condom.      Taking It Off  Right after ejaculation (coming):  Hold on tight to the condom at the rim (at the base of the penis) and pull out slowly while the penis is still erect. This will keep the condom from slipping off inside your partner or any semen from being spilled.  Increasing Comfort  Insufficient lubrication can cause discomfort and chafing or condom breakage. Place a small amount of the water-based lubricant (e.g., KY Jelly) on the inside of the condom tip before unrolling it. This can increase sensation for the condom wearer. After unrolling the condom over the erect penis, place some of the water-based lubricant on the outside of the condom.  Extra Protection (for pregnancy prevention)   For vaginal sex, also use an applicator filled with spermicide inside the vagina for extra protection in the event of breakage. If the condom breaks, spermicidal jelly or foam should be inserted immediately into your partner.  Condoms are available in many varieties: colors, flavors, shapes, textures, lubricated, non-lubricated, with or without spermicide--almost any type to meet different needs. You may want to experiment with the type of condom that is most satisfactory to you and your partner.   How to Use Female Condoms  For vaginal sex, another option is to use a female condom to prevent pregnancy, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections.Â  Women can insert the female condom ahead of time which allows for more spontaneity.Â  To insert the female condom, find a comfortable position.Â  Try standing with one foot up on a chair or sit with knees apart or squat down.Â  Ensure the inner ring is at the bottom (closed) end of the pouch.Â  Hold the pouch with the open end hanging down. While holding the outside of the pouch, squeeze the inner ring between your thumb and middle finger. With your other hand, spread the labia of the vagina open and insert the squeezed end of the condom into opening.Â  Now push the inner ring and the pouch the rest of the way up past the pubic bone.Â  Its also important that the outside ring lies against the outer labia.Â  To remove, squeeze and twist the outer ring to keep the sperm inside the pouch. Gently pull out the pouch and discard in the trash; do not flush down the toilet.  How to Use Spermicides  Spermicide is inserted close to the cervix within 30 minutes of intercourse. Use a new application for each act of intercourse or if there is a delay of intercourse for more than 30 minutes after application. Because spermicides are not very effective in preventing pregnancy they should only be used with another form of contraception such as a condom.  Advantages and Disadvantages of Condoms and Spermicides  Advantages include:  readily available over the counter, no exam necessary    allow the man to take an active role and shared responsibility in preventing pregnancy      causes no serious health risk      may increase ability to maintain erection longer      provide lubrication      inexpensive     Disadvantages may include:    may interrupt lovemaking because the condom must be placed on erect penis and the spermicide must be inserted into the vagina prior to intercourse     ineffective if used incorrectly or if the condom breaks      may reduce sensitivity and pleasure      may cause allergic reactions to latex, spermicide, or lubricant used with the condom      may be messy or inconvenient      necessitates prompt withdrawal to keep the condom from slipping off      may result in less energetic lovemaking from fear that condom may slip off or break      may taste bad (scented condoms such as mint are not spermicidally lubricated)      may not protect against transmission of STIs transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact (e.g. HPV, herpes)     Condoms and STIs  Although not 100% effective, for sexually active people condoms provide the best means of protection available today for Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). Condoms cannot prevent STI transmission, but they can help reduce the risk. However, animal membrane condoms (lambskin) do not give protection against HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases. Therefore, the use of latex and polyurethane condoms with nonoxynol-9 is highly recommended.  The Condom Comeback  Here are some suggestions for how to encourage a partner to use condoms:  Condom excuse: ""It doesn't feel good."" Condom comebacks: ""If you're uncomfortable using condoms then let's try something other than intercourse."" ""Neither does sleeping alone.""  Condom excuse: ""It spoils the mood."" Condom comebacks: ""The mood will come back."" ""So does your attitude.""   Condom excuse: ""It takes too long."" Condom comebacks: ""Then you need practice and there's no time like the present."" ""Let me help you put it on."" ""A condom can make sex last longer."" ""We have all night. What's the rush?"" ""It's worth the wait.""  Condom excuse: ""You won't catch anything from me."" Condom comebacks: ""Yes, but you might catch something from me."" ""I know I won't, because either we use a condom or we are not having intercourse."" ""Then you won't get anything from me.""  Condom excuse: ""Just this once won't matter."" Condom comebacks: ""It only takes once."" ""Then just this once I'll have to say no.""     Back to Top  Depo-Provera What is Depo-Provera? Depo-Provera is an injectable progestin (hormone) that acts similarly to other progestin-only contraceptives. Depo-Provera works by preventing the development of the egg and by changing the cervical mucus, thus helping to prevent the sperm from reaching the egg. One injection provides 12 weeks of protection so you must return to your health care provider every 12 weeks for another injection. Depo-Provera can be used safely and effectively as a contraceptive by most women. Depo-Provera does not protect against STIs, so always use a condom.Â  You must return to your health care provider every 12 weeks for another injection. Depo-Provera tends to make a woman's periods less regular, and spotting between periods is fairly common. Some women stop having periods completely. If your pattern of bleeding concerns you, return to your health care provider for follow-up.Â  Furthermore, you should contact your provider if you develop any of the following:Â  weight gain, depression, headaches, frequent urination, or heavy bleeding. Benefits and Disadvantages Depo-Provera is greater than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy in both theory and actual use. The specific benefits include: causes no serious complications such as those occasionally associated with estrogen-containing pills (contains no estrogen)  provides highly effective, long acting protection against pregnancy  convenient, does not interfere with intercourse  decreases menstrual cramps in some cases  reduced risk of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, endometrial and ovarian cancers  Some of the disadvantages may include: causes menstrual cycle irregularities for most users  may decrease bone density  may experience weight gain, water retention, breast tenderness  long term lipid effects are unknown  requires an injection  provides no protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STIs)  Depo-Provera is not a good choice if you want to be pregnant in the next year or two, as it may take from nine to twenty-four months after you stop taking Depo-Provera to regain your fertility  Back to Top  Emergency Contraception Emergency Contraceptive Pills, or ECPs, are not a true form of contraception. Rather, ECP is a means to protect yourself against pregnancy after an unexpected incident of unprotected sex, whether consensual or non-consensual. Additional information about ECP can be found on our Other Sexual Health Issues page. Back to Top  More Information Method Match helps you to select the contraceptive that best meets your needs--you can compare up to four methods based on effectiveness or frequency of use to determine which is right for you. Family Practice notebook.com contains an excellent section on Contraception Management which includes detailed information concerning various contraceptive methods. The site also provides particularly useful information about oral contraceptives, including guidelines for managing possible side effects.

Student Blue - Health Plan for WSSU Students Students are offered the Student Health insurance through Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina (BCBSNC) which will cover most costs associated with clinical visits. The charge associated with the BCBSNC insurance will not be billed to studentsâ€™ account if students are covered by an alternate medical insurance plan comparable to the BCBSNC plan. The NC Medicaid plan will be evaluated on the same criteria as other medical plans. Students are responsible for all charges not covered by their respective medical plans.  For students who do not have the Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina Student Insurance, as required by your insurance company, your co-payment is due at time of service.     History and Medical Immunization Requirements      The State of NC and the University Registrar requires official proof of certain immunizations when attending college in NC, prior to arrival on campus.

Students with the Ohio University Student Injury Sickness Plan through United Health Care Resources are required to get a referral from OhioHealth Campus Care for all specialty care.  We can provide the referral, but it is the studentâ€™s responsibility to verify if the specialist is an in-network provider with their insurance company and to understand their insurance coverage.   Back to Top    Physicals  OhioHealth Campus Care can accommodate the majority of your needs for physical exams. Students are required to bring all necessary documents and a list of requirements for the physical, along with the actual physical form that must be completed and signed by the provider.  Several physicals require a review of immunizations. Please obtain official documentation of these immunizations that include immunization dates prior to your visit to OhioHealth Campus Care. Physicals will not be performed without proper forms and documentation.   Many physicals require that you have a tuberculosisÂ test. Please confirm if this is a requirement for your physical, and what type of TB is needed (PPD, 1-step,Â 2-step or IGRA blood test). You must have the test completed prior to having your physical exam. Contact OhioHealth Campus Care for TB testing hours. If TB testing is a requirement of a physical, and you do not have the test results with you, the physical will not be completed.   Back to Top     Sexually Transmitted Infections  One in two sexually active people will contract a sexually transmitted infection (STI) by the age of 25.Â  However, a recent study shows that only about 12% of young people were tested for STIs in the past year.Â  While there is no â€œtest for everythingâ€, the providers at OhioHealth Campus Care are able to offer you the most up to date, individualized testing recommendations based on your personal practices. Many students are eligible to have some or all of the recommended tests performed for free!   There are multiple ways to be evaluated for STIs at Campus Care.   If you are having symptoms of an STI includingÂ pain with urination, pain with intercourse, discharge from your penis or vagina, testicular pain, rectal pain or discharge, sores or warts on your genitals, or vaginal bleeding after intercourse, you will need to see a provider for evaluation.Â  You can do this by going to the 1 st floor Quick Care clinic for a walk-in appointment or by scheduling an appointment with the 2 nd floor Primary Care clinic (740.592.7100).  If you are not having symptoms but have questions or concerns you would like to discuss with a provider, you can do this by going to the 1 st floor Quick Care clinic for a walk-in appointment or by scheduling an appointment with the 2 nd floor Primary Care clinic (740.592.7100).Â  If you are not having symptoms and prefer testing without seeing a provider for consultation, read the information below about the Self-Directed STI Testing option.   Self-Directed Screening for Sexually Transmitted Infections  Self-directed screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is available by checking in at the 1 st floor registration desk anytime Campus Care is open.Â  It is a convenient, private way for you to be aware of your STI status without needing to see a provider. Self-directed testing is an option up to two times per academic year.Â  If you would like to be tested more frequently, or if you would like to discuss specific exposures and concerns, we encourage you to meet with a provider.   Self-directed screening is an option ONLY if all the following statements are true:     You are not having any symptoms of an STI- Symptoms of an STI may include pain with urination, pain with intercourse, discharge from your penis or vagina, testicular pain, rectal pain or discharge, sores or warts on your genitals, or vaginal bleeding after intercourse.   ***** IF YOU HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS, YOU NEED TO SEE A PROVIDER *****    You are not pregnant    You do not have HIV    Your partner(s) do not have HIV    You are not interested in receiving more information about STIs or birth control today    If you do not meet the criteria above, you will need to see a provider so we can best advise you about testing and treatment options.    What tests are right for me?    When you check in, you will be given an information packet.Â  You will use it to determine what testing is recommended for you based on your personal sexual practices and timing of your possible exposures.    How are the samples collected?    For some types of infection, samples must be taken from the source of the possible exposure (urethra, vagina, or rectum).Â  These tests are self-collected which means we give you a cotton swab or urine cup and tell you how to collect your own specimen in the bathroom.Â  For other types of infection, testing is done through a blood sample (sometimes just a pin prick on your finger), throat or cheek swab.Â  Nursing or lab staff will assist you with collecting these samples.    How much will all of this cost?     Many students are eligible to have some or all of the recommended tests performed for free! For those who are not eligible for free testing, we will provide you with a price list to give you a general idea about the costs if your insurance does not cover testing or you chose not to have it billed to your insurance. Some insurance companies do not cover the cost of STI testing unless you are having symptoms of an infection.Â  Some cover chlamydia and gonorrhea testing once a year for women as part of their annual well woman coverage, but they might need to see a provider for it to be covered.Â  You can check with your insurance company to find out the specifics of your plan before you have the tests performed.   Back to Top     Laboratory  Students enrolled for one (1) or more credit hours can obtain services at the OhioHealth Campus Care laboratory.  Internal laboratory procedures will be billed the studentâ€™s medical insurance. Copayments, after insurance balances, and self-pay balances are placed on the studentsâ€™ MyOHIO student account. Payments for services can be made at OhioHealth Campus Care, the Office of the Bursar, or online through the students MyOHIO account.  Laboratory procedures that cannot be tested at OhioHealth Campus Care will be sent to OhioHealth Oâ€™Bleness Laboratory. Medical insurance should be provided by the student to OhioHealth Campus Care at the time of service. As long as the insurance information is provided, OhioHealth Campus Care will submit the information to the external testing site. The student will receive an invoice directly from OhioHealth Oâ€™Bleness Health System. The student is responsible for all after-insurance and self-pay balances. It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to provide medical insurance information and understand the insurance coverage. A $9Â collection fee will also be billed to the student's insurance by OhioHealth Campus Care.  Does the laboratory accept orders from external providers?  We accept orders from any medical provider in the United States. If the test is to be done on a routine basis, the provider needs to indicate that this is a â€œstanding orderâ€ and they should also specify the frequency. Orders from outside providers are valid for one year after they are written, even if they are standing orders.  Procedure for a student wishing to use an order from an outside provider:  Bring the order to OhioHealth Campus Care or have the order faxed to 740.592.7112 (Attention: Laboratory). The order MUST include the ordering providers contact information and signature. OhioHealth Campus Care cannot do the testing without this information.  At each visit, check-in at first floor registration desk. Patient supportÂ associates will collect all pertinent information, including medical insurance information. It is important that medical insurance information is provided or the student will receive a bill from OhioHealth Oâ€™Bleness Laboratory for the entire amount. It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to provide medical insurance information and understand theÂ insurance coverage.   The ordering provider will receive the testing results directly from OhioHealth Oâ€™Bleness Laboratory. If the ordering provider does not receive the results, please contact OhioHealth Oâ€™Bleness Laboratory directly at 740.593.5551 and ask to speak with the Out-patient Laboratory.   Back to Top    X-Ray  Students enrolled for 1 or more credit hours are eligible to obtain service at the OhioHealt Campus Care Radiology Department. All diagnostic X-raysÂ will be acquired digitally and the computed radiography system will produce a digitalÂ X-rayÂ image.  As a courtesy, OhioHealth Campus Care will bill the studentâ€™s medical insurance for all X-ray services. It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to provide their medical insurance information and understand theÂ insurance coverage. Co-payments, after-insurance balances, and self-pay balances are assessed to the students MyOHIO Student Center. Payment for services can be made at OhioHealth Campus Care, at the Office of the Bursar, or online through the student's MyOHIO account.    If the Radiology Department is closed during clinic hours of operation, OhioHealth Campus CareÂ associates will transport patients to and from OhioHealth Oâ€™Bleness Hospital Radiology Department for the X-ray  exam. Please note if you have the university-sponsored student health insurance plan you will be subject to co-pays, deductiblesÂ and co-insurance.    A prescription or provider order form must accompany all requested x-raysÂ with the following information on the order:   X-rayÂ examination requested  Diagnostic reason for the X-ray   Previous history  Ordering provider name  Patient name  Patient date of birth   Abdominal X-rays on Female Patients  It is the policy ofÂ OhioHealth Campus Care to avoid X-ray examination of the pelvis or abdomen of a potentially pregnant woman. If the date of the X-ray exam falls on day 11 or greater of the menstrual cycle, and the provider and patient decide for medical reasons that X-ray sÂ of the lumbar spine, sacrum, coccyx, abdomen, pelvisÂ or hip are necessary, the patient will be required to have a pregnancy test performed.  Does the X-ray Department accept orders from outside providers?  We accept orders from any licensed medical provider in the United States. Your provider may write you an order or the order can be faxed to 740.592.7112. Please provide information that will allow us to submit a final report to the ordering provider. Orders from outside providers are valid for one year after they are written.  Procedure for a student wishing to use an order from an outside provider:  Bring the order to OhioHealth Campus Care or have the order faxed to 740.592.7112 (Attention: Radiology).  Check in at first floor registration desk. Patient supportÂ associates will collect all pertinent information, including medical insurance information, before sending you to the Radiology Department.  The Radiology Department will fax the results to the ordering provider. If the contact information for the requesting provider is not on the order the student should obtain it before coming for the exam.

To schedule an appointment for the second floor Continuity Clinic, call 740.592.7100. If this is your first visit to OhioHealth Campus Care, please arrive 15 minutes prior to your scheduled appointment to complete required paperwork.  Reasons to seek gynecological care:    Birth control (IUD's, Implants, Pills, Emergency contraception, etc. check out this website about long-acting reversible contraception: https://www.choiceproject.wustl.edu/ )   Sores or bumps on the vulva  Vaginal discharge, itching  Screening and management of sexually transmitted infections (STI's)  Routine cervical cancer screening (Pap tests)  Abnormal pap tests in the past  Annual well exam  Pregnancy testing and nonjudgmental pregnancy options discussion  Ovarian cysts  Endometriosis evaluation  Pelvic pain  Painful or too frequent urination  Pain with intercourse  Premenstrual symptoms  Problems with periods (irregular, heavy, long, painful or infrequent periods)  Questions about gender or sexuality  Breast concerns  Moderate to severe acne  HPV vaccination  Any other pelvic or gynecological concern you may have   Contraceptive Counseling  This is a free service that utilizes contraceptive counselors to educate patients about their birth control options based on their personal health history and goals for contraception.Â  It is run through the 2 nd floor Continuity Care Clinic in coordination with Dr. Balbo and Dr. Duval.Â  Please call 740.592.7100 to schedule your appointment.  This is a great option for people who:   are considering starting or switching to a new method . Counselors offer individualized recommendations to help patients decide which method would be the best fit for them  would like an implant or IUD . This visit can expedite the process for verifying if the patient's insurance will cover the cost of the device. The counselors can also help the patient plan the timing of the insertion based on othe factors such as their period and the method of birth control they currently use. It can decrease the number of visits to the clinic and the number of visits the patient has to pay for  want more infomation about contraceptive options without having to pay for the visit and without the visit showing up on their insurance  want great appointment availability or more time for discussing birth control options   There is no charge for contraceptive counseling which includes discussing information about contraceptive options, helping someone check with their insurance to find out if an implant or IUD is covered, or planning for an IUD or implant insertion.   ***However , if after discussing their options, a patient chooses to start pills, patches, rings, or the shot , we would bill insurance if the patient wants a prescription. Contraceptive counselors are not able to write prescriptions, so one of the doctors would see the patient at the end of their contraceptive counseling visit and provide the prescription.Â  This will allow the patient to receive their prescription the same day without having to return another day. However, it would add a doctor visit, so a fee would apply.Â  Patients will be informed that it would be billed to their insurance and given the option to proceed with a doctor visit for a prescription or not.  This visit is not a substitute for an annual well person exam.Â  It is a resource for information specifically about contraception, but does not address the full scope of topics covered in an annual exam.Â  Someone may have a contraceptive counseling visit to get more information prior to their annual exam, but it is not a replacement for an annual exam.Â  This is  not  the best option for people who are happy with their birth control pills/patches/ring/depo and would just like a  refill the same method  .Â  For those people, it is best to schedule an annual exam as usual with a provider.   Overview of what patient can expect during the contraceptive counseling visit:    Check in with the receptionist on the 2nd floor of Campus Care  Fill out intake form  Go to private room. Check weight, blood pressure, pulse  Review intake form with contraceptive counselor  Counselor will give a general overview of all your options and help you compare how effective the method is , common side effects, possible risks, and additional benefits fo the methods to help you determine which is the best fit for you  The counselor will then briefly leave the room to review the plan of care with one of the doctors  They will return to the room and give you more detailed information about the method you chose, when to start, what to expect, when it starts to work, how to verify if your insurance will cover the method, and will answer questions or give resources for more information   All of the information from these visits is confidential and protected by HIPPA.Â  There is no physical examination or pelvic exam at this visit.Â  You do not have to get undressed.Â  Plan to be at the clinic for about 30-45 minutes.   Back to Top    Emergency Contraception  Emergency contraception is birth control women can use for up to 5 days after unprotected sex to decrease the risk of unintended pregnancy.Â  It may be something people consider if they had vaginal intercourse after missing two or more birth control pills, missing a birth control shot, being forced to have sex, having a condom break or slip off during intercourse or simply getting caught up in the moment and not using a condom.Â  A lot of people have heard of Plan B or â€œthe morning after pillâ€ but not many people know about the other  more effective options  for emergency contraception.Â  Most people also do not know about the  relationship between how much a person weighs and how that affects how well emergency contraceptive pills work  .  All of the options listed below are available at Campus Care.Â  Most insurance companies cover all forms of emergency contraception at little or no cost to the patient.Â  The list below is from most effective to least effective options.  1. The COPPER INTRAUTERINE DEVICE (IUD) is more than 99% effective for emergency contraception, making it the most effective option for all women .Â  It can be used by women of any weight, at any point in their cycles for up to 5 days after unprotected sex. It can be left in place for up to 12 years if a woman desires ongoing, highly effective contraception.Â  Or it can be removed at any time before that.Â  The ability to get pregnant returns almost immediately after it is removed.Â  If you are interested in a Copper IUD , call to schedule an appointment on the 2 nd floor to discuss an IUD for emergency contraception.   Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECPs) are one-time dose pills can be taken for up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse but work best when taken as soon as possible. The efficacy of ECPs varies greatly depending on a number of factors.Â  In some cases, they may not be effective at all. Emergency contraceptive pills can be used repeatedly over the course of a womanâ€™s life without any long-term impact on her fertility or health. The risk of unintended pregnancy, however, is high when compared to other contraceptive methods There are two types of ECPs.Â  The details are listed below.  2. ELLA is a one-time dose pill that affects the receptors of the hormone progestin.Â  Ella requires a prescription and many insurance plans cover it.Â  If yours doesnâ€™t, the cost for ella is about $50.Â  If you are interested in ella, please go to Quick Care on the 1 st floor to discuss",0.05139465,0.076364164,LARC

Our Services  Well-Woman Exam All women, whether you are having sex or not, should have a well-woman exam at least once a year. A well-woman exam includes a general check of your health and may include a physical exam of your breasts and pelvic organs and blood tests if indicated. During this exam the healthcare practitioner will obtain a health history. This includes asking questions about your past illnesses, family history, current medications, and menstrual cycle. Your healthcare practitioner will also provide information to help you stay healthy and answer any questions you may have.  Routine Pap Smear The Pap smear checks for changes in the cells of your cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens to the vagina (birth canal). The Pap smear is a screen for cervical cancer.  It is now recommended that women have their first Pap smear when they are 21 years of age. It is no longer recommended that women less than 21 or over 65 years of age have a Pap smear. A Pap smear is now recommended every 3 years between the ages of 21 and 30 and every 5 years between 30 and 65 when a test for HPV is included, assuming no abnormal results are obtained.  Breast Exams A breast exam helps detect abnormalities in the breasts that might indicate cancer or other problems.  Contraception Contraception reduces the risk of pregnancy. There are many types of contraception; some require a prescription from a healthcare practitioner or a medical procedure while others may be purchased over- the- counter. Some forms of birth control are reversible and others are permanent and cannot be reversed. Common forms of contraception include devices, prescriptions, behavioral methods, over-the-counter, and permanent procedures.  Some examples of birth control methods are:  Permanent Procedures   Tubal sterilization   Prescription Products   Birth control pills  NuvaRing (ring)  Depo-Provera (The Shot)  Diaphragms, caps, and shields   Over-the-Counter Products   Male condoms  Female condoms  Contraceptive sponge  Spermicides   Behavioral Method   Abstinence   Immunizations (including Gardasil ) There are vaccines available for women and men ages 9 to 26 years that can prevent infection with HPV, a virus which may lead to genital warts and cervical, anal and other genital cancers.  Prevention and treatment of STDâ€™s There are more than 25 types of organisms that cause sexually transmitted infections (STIâ€™s). STIâ€™s are capable of being spread from person to person during sexual activity. Common symptoms of an STI include itching, abnormal vaginal discharge, burning during urination, pain during intercourse, blisters, or warts. Some STIâ€™s have no symptoms, but may still be passed to others and may cause problems even if there are no symptoms. Untreated STIâ€™s can have severe consequences for a woman, such as infertility.  If you think you have an STI, call the Student Health Center to schedule an appointment. We offer confidential STI and HIV testing. We also provide therapy for STIâ€™s that are curable and treatment to help minimize the symptoms of STIâ€™s that are not.  Diagnosis and treatment of Vaginitis Vaginitis is an infection of the vagina. A change in vaginal discharge, itching, pain, or burning are common symptoms of vaginitis. There are 4 major kinds of vaginitis, bacterial vaginosis, Trichomoniasis, yeast infection, and atrophic vaginitis. These types of vaginitis may require different treatments, so an exam to determine which kind is causing symptoms is often needed.

While we care for all enrolled UNT students at the SHWC, we know there are special needs unique to some of our student population. We strive to meet your gynecological health care needs with a specialist dedicated to providing a confidential, caring environment. A full time gynecologist, assisted by several other medical providers, are on staff daily to address routine concerns as well as provide valuable resources for patient education on a variety of related subjects.  Gynecological services offered at the SHWC include the following:  Back to Top  Abnormal PAP Smear Consultation and Colposcopy   Colposcopy  Colposcopy (colpo) is a basic procedure to look closely at the cervix and vagina and may be recommended if you have an abnormal pap smear. Â The machine is similar to a large microscope and is used in order to see these areas at a greater magnification and look for any possible abnormalities. Â The colposcopy itself does not hurt at all â€“ it is just like a longer version of a pap smear. Â 90% of the colposcopy is spent with the gynecologist looking at areas that may be causing the abnormal cells on the pap smear. Â  If any of these areas are identified, a small biopsy may be taken and sent to pathology to determine further management. Â This may cause some minor cramping, similar to menstrual cramps, but can be eased by taking an over the counter pain reliever 30 minutes prior to the procedure.  A colposcopy can be done at the SHWC with our staff gynecologist. Â If you have had a recent abnormal pap smear and were advised to have a colpo for further evaluation, please call (940)565-2333 for a consultation with our gynecologist. Â During that visit, the entire process will be explained in detail and you will be given a chance to ask any questions before the appointment is made for the actual procedure.  Back to Top  Birth Control Options   Birth Control Pills  Birth control pills are one of the top forms of contraception that has been availableÂ in the United States since 1960. The pills taken today are much different from those first pills that came out many years ago. Today, all birth control pills are considered to be low dose â€“ this refers to the amount of estrogen each pill contains. The effective doses of estrogen range from 10mcg to 35mcg in each pill available today. Older pills contained as much as 50-75mcg of estrogen, which was responsible for increased chance of side effects during that time.  In the majority of cases, birth control pills are a combination of estrogen and progesterone. It is important that you take birth control pills every day, around the same time every day. There are alarms you can set on your phone or even apps to help you remember. When taken correctly, birth control pills have an effective rate of 99%, but it is hard to take them perfectly all the time. The typical effectiveness rate is about 92-96%. Birth control pills do not protect against STDs or HIV and consistent condom use is recommended. In addition to preventing pregnancy, birth control pills can help make periods shorter with lighter menstrual bleeding and can also significantly improve painful cramps. Birth control pills are not for everyone do to their associated risk of side effects.  If you have questions about birth control pills or contraception in general, please contact the SHWC for an appointment to speak with one of the providers about your concerns. You can call (940)565-2333 or go online to schedule an appointment.  Intrauterine Device (IUDs)  An IUD is a long acting form of birth control that has become much more popular over the last several years. Â There are currently 3 types of IUDs available in the US â€“ 2 that contain the hormone progesterone and 1 that does not contain any hormones. Â The progesterone containing IUDs are the most common: Mirena lasts for 5 years and the newer, smaller version, Skyla, for 3 years. Â Both of these are now available at the SHWC.  IUDs are very effective against preventing pregnancy â€“ greater than 99%. Â In addition to their contraceptive uses, IUDs can typically help with heavy periods and painful cramping. Â After the first few months, periods are typically several days shorter, with much lighter bleeding and decreased cramping. Â Some people donâ€™t have periods at all! Â People who have an IUD will tell you they love not having to worry about taking a pill every day or remember to get a shot every 3 months. Â It is one less thing a busy college student has to worry about.  As with any birth control, there are some risks associated with an IUD and they are not recommended for everyone. Â One common misconception is that you have to have had a child before you can get an IUD. Â This used to be a recommendation but is no longer valid. Â In fact, younger individuals who have not had children are the specific group the manufacturers of the newer IUD, Skyla, had in mind when coming up with this product. Â As with any method of birth control, IUDs do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases and consistent condom use is always recommended.  If you are interested in learning more about IUDs and if they would be a reasonable option for you, please call (940) 565-2333 to schedule a consultation with the gynecologist.  Nexplanon  Nexplanon is a long acting contraceptive implant that provides birth control for 3 years. Â The device is a small, flexible plastic rod that contains the hormone progesterone and is inserted under the skin of the upper arm. It is easily inserted at an office visit and numbing medicine is used beforehand so it is quick and painless. Â The implant can be felt under the skin but not seen so it is very discreet.  It is one of the most effective types of birth control available and has a pregnancy prevention rate greater than 99%. Â Many people prefer Nexplanon over other forms of birth control, like the pill, because they do not have to remember to take it at the same time every day and they donâ€™t have to think about birth control for the next 3 years. Â Like other forms of birth control, Nexplanon does not prevent against any sexually transmitted diseases and consistent condom use is recommended. Â Also, as with any form of birth control, there can be risks associated with Nexplanon as well as possible side effects.  If you have questions about Nexplanon or contraception in general, please contact the SHWC for an appointment to speak with the staff gynecologist. Â You can call (940)565-2333 or go online at www.myosh.unt.edu to schedule an appointment.  For questions regarding Plan B contact the UNT Pharmacy .  Back to Top  Painful Periods(Cramps)   Menstrual cramps are one of the most common complaintsÂ when it comes to issues with periods. Painful menstrual cramping, also known as dysmenorrhea, affects a majority of reproductive age individuals at some point in their lives, with as many as 90% of teenagers affected. Symptoms can gradually worsen over the years until the pain becomes so severe they miss work or school 1 or more days each month.  Menstrual cramps typically begin prior to the onset of bleeding and can last for 1-2 days of the cycle. Patients often experience pain in their lower back and thighs. Other symptoms that can be associated with the onset of bleeding are headaches, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and occasionally diarrhea. In a majority of cases, dysmenorrhea is due to natural chemicals called prostaglandins produced in the body that are released in menstrual blood. These substances cause increased uterine contractions and pain. In a majority of cases, cramps can be controlled by taking NSAIDs (Advil, ibuprofen, Aleve, etc.) during the first few days of the period. Another great option that helps control the pain caused by periods as some of the other symptoms listed above are birth control pills. Not only does the pill prevent pregnancy, it can make periods much more tolerable.  If you suffer from painful periods, please contact the SHWC for an appointment to speak with one our medical providers about your concerns. You can call (940) 565-2333 or go online to schedule an appointment.  Back to Top  Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Testing, Counseling, and Treatment   Genital Herpes (HSV)  One of the most common STDs is genital herpes, with more than 750,000 new infections each year. It is caused by an infection with the herpes virus (HSV), of which there are 2 types: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Oral lesions associated with HSV-1 are also known as â€œcold soresâ€ or â€œfever blistersâ€ but can be present in the genital region as well. Typically, HSV-2 only infects the genitals. Once you have been exposed to the virus, it stays with you for the rest of your life, but that does not mean you will have symptoms forever, as the disease usually becomes milder over a period of years.  HSV is passed between partners through vaginal, oral, and anal intercourse as well as direct skin to skin contact. HSV infections are characterized by multiple blisters on the penis or vulva that eventually break open to form shallow, painful ulcers. These ulcers eventually heal completely in a few weeks, leaving no evidence of any disease. This is an example of an â€œoutbreak.â€ If you have sores, cuts, or areas of irritation that tend to reappear, this may be recurring outbreaks and it is important to come in and be evaluated. Even though the virus is always present in the body, there are medications available to help prevent outbreaks and/or make them shorter, milder and reduce the risk of transmission of the disease to others.  Many people with herpes infections may not experience an outbreak and never know they have the disease, thereby unknowingly transmitting it to others. The virus may also be passed between partners when no active sores are present in a phenomenon known as asymptomatic viral shedding. It is impossible to know how you will react to an infection with HSV â€“ some will never even know they have the disease, others may have only a few outbreaks in their lifetime, and some will have issues with recurrent outbreaks several times per year. It is important to avoid any sexual activity if any suspicious lesions are present and condoms are a crucial way to help prevent the spread of the disease.  If you have questions about herpes or are worried about a possible infection, please contact the SHWC for an appointment to speak with one of the providers about your concerns. You can call (940) 565-2333 or go online to schedule an appointment.  Genital Warts  Another very common STD is genital warts. Â Genital warts are caused by an infection with human papilloma virus (HPV). Â Over 100 different types of HPV have been identified with more than 40 infecting the genital tract alone. Â In many cases, these infections often go undetected unless a person has an abnormal pap smear or a person develops genital warts that can be seen.  In the majority of cases of genital HPV infections, the warts are asymptomatic (do not cause any problems) but can be very bothersome to patients emotionally as well as cosmetically. Â The lesions are usually flesh colored growths of varying sizes that can be flat or elevated. Â It is common to have several groups or clusters of warts on the penisÂ orÂ labia or at the opening of the vagina. Â If the warts grow large enough, they can be itchy or painful depending on their location. Â Warts can be treated several different ways, many of which are provided at the SHWC. Â Your provider can help you decide which method may be the best option for you. Â There is also a vaccine (Gardasil) availableÂ which is effective against 2 types of HPV which cause 90% of genital warts. Â This is a series of 3 injections, which is also available at the SHWC.  If you have questions about genital warts, HPV infections, or the Gardasil vaccine, please contact the SHWC for an appointment to speak with one of the providers about your concerns. Â You can call (940) 565-2333 or go online at www.myosh.unt.edu to schedule an appointment.  Back to Top  Urinary Tract Infections   Urinary tract complaints are a very common reasonÂ to seek care with their medical provider. It is much more common for individuals with vaginas to get a urinary tract infection (UTI or bladder infection) based simply on their anatomy. The urethra (the tube that connects the bladder to the outside of our body) is much shorter and therefore more susceptible to becoming infected with bacteria that are normally found in the genital region.  Symptoms of a UTI include: frequency of urination, pain or burning during or at the end of urination, pelvic pain, back or side pain, and blood in the urine. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. A patient can develop fever and chills as well as nausea and/or vomiting in a severe infection. If left untreated, UTIs can turn into severe kidney infections which may require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. It is important to seek medical care if you think you might have a UTI. When you make an appointment at the SHWC, a urine sample is collected and tested while you wait to see if an infection is present. If so, a short course of antibiotics will be prescribed. The symptoms typically resolve in a few days with medical treatment.  The likelihood of getting a UTI increases with sexual activity, therefore it is important to remember to empty your bladder immediately after intercourse. Also, always practice good hygiene. Drinking plenty of fluids can help flush the bladder as well. These are just a few of the ways to help prevent a UTI from developing.  Back to Top  Vaginal Infections   Bacterial Vaginosis  Most peopleof reproductive age will have symptoms of increased vaginal discharge, odor, and itching/irritation at some point. These symptoms are consistent with a vaginal infection. Typically, patients will assume they have a yeast infection and treat with an over the counter medication. This may be the case, but a more common vaginal infection is bacterial vaginosis (BV). These infections can be very similar to one another and difficult to tell apart, especially if you have never had something similar before.  BV is characterized by a thin, clear or whitish vaginal discharge and usually, an odor is present. Irritation and itching can occur, although in most cases, it is milder than what patients experience with yeast infections. BV is not considered a sexually transmitted disease. A simple test called a wet prep can be done at the SHWC to tell what type of infection is present. The results are ready in about 15 minutes. If the test confirms bacterial vaginosis, a prescription will be written for antibiotics. It will usually resolve with medication in about a week.  If you think you might have a vaginal infection, please contact the SHWC for an appointment to speak with one of the providers about your concerns. You can call (940) 565-2333 or go online to schedule an appointment.  Yeast Infections  Yeast infections are common and most peopleÂ will get a yeast infection at least once in their lifetime. Some individualswill have infections occurring more frequently â€“ up to several times per year. Typical symptoms of a yeast infection are fairly well recognizedÂ and include thick, white vaginal discharge and itching. The skin in the genital region may be red and swollen or irritated. Sometimes, symptoms may be more subtle and harder for a patient to figure out what is going on. For example, there may be itching or irritation only and no discharge. Many vaginal infections can present in the same way, making self-diagnosis more difficult.  With a pelvic examination and testing done at the time of an appointment at the SHWC, a yeast infection can be easily diagnosed. Patients have a variety of treatment options, including a one-time dose of oral medication or traditional vaginal preparations that can be purchased over the counter. Symptoms usually resolve quickly with either type of medication.  If you think you might have a vaginal infection, please contact the SHWC for an appointment to speak with one of the providers about your concerns. You can call (940) 565-2333 or go online to schedule an appointment.

Our medical services are located in SC-221.                Services Offered       Allergies     Emergencies  Call one of the following:   Your family doctor  Poison Control Hotline: 1-800-222-1222  Call 911    Allergies are generally a major cause of seasonal or year-round nose and sinus problems.
                                 Allergies are caused by a release of a chemical substance in the body called histamine.
                                 This chemical is responsible for producing the symptoms of allergies. Allergies can
                                 appear at any age, and often run in families. Allergic reactions can result from things
                                 such as; certain foods, plants, pollens, dust, animal hair, feathers, molds, soaps,
                                 cosmetics, and clothes.  Signs and symptoms of allergies include:   Itching or watery eyes  Skin rashes such as eczema or hives  Chronic colds  Nasal or sinus congestion  Itching  Sneezing  Runny nose   If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, make an appointment as SHS. Allergies
                                 can be effectively treated and controlled.  If you are receiving Allergy Immunotherapy (shots), we can arrange to keep your serums
                                 and administer your injections. The cost is $2.00 per shot.

People don't choose to be depressed, and it is not
                                 because you are weak or lazy. Depression affects 17 million people in the U.S. each
                                 year and is twice as common in women as in men.

It is known that chemical imbalances in

Preventative Health Care     Emergencies  Call one of the following:   Your family doctor  Poison Control Hotline: 1-800-222-1222  Call 911    Five Habits of Highly Effective Students   Eat well and regularly. Make good food choices and avoid fad diets.  Drink! At least 8 full glasses of water a day. Avoid excessive caffeine, carbonation
                                    and alcohol.  Exercise. Experts recommend 30-45 minutes of daily exercise to lose weight and 30
                                    minutes 3x/week to maintain weight. Exercise will help you concentrate better, relieve
                                    stress and have more energy.  Get plenty of rest. Go to bed before 11 pm to avoid adverse effects on your natural
                                    sleep-wake cycle. If you are well rested, your immune system is strengthened.  Wash your hands! This is the most important thing you can do to prevent illness and
                                    the spread of disease.   Many times common illnesses are caused by viruses. There is no cure for viral infection.
                                 Antibiotics will not help. The best advice is to follow the 5 habits listed above
                                 and treat the symptoms. If your illness lasts longer than 10 days, you have a persistent
                                 fever, or your symptoms are worsening, then you should make an appointment with your
                                 health care provider.  Is it a Virus, Bacteria or Allergy???       VIRUS  BACTERIA  ALLERGY    Runny nose?  Often  Rare  Often    Aching muscles?

You should get tested for STIs if any of the listed risk factors apply to you:   You have unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex;  A condom breaks;  Your partner has or has had an STI;  You or your partner inject street drugs;  You have a new sex partner;  You have had more than one partner in the past six months;  Your partner has or had sex with another person;  You have sex under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol; or  You are unable to communicate with your partner about your sexual history and ways
                                    to reduce risks.   Some STI tests require samples of body fluids like semen or vaginal secretions. Others
                                 require a simple blood test. SHS Medical Staff will discuss the cost of each test.
                                 The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) estimates that there are more
                                 than 25 STIs in existence. Listed here are the four most common STIs in the United
                                 States. Click on a specific STI below to learn more.   Genital HPV Infection  Trichomoniasis  Chlamydia  Genital Herpes     Tuberculosis (TB) Testing    All new or returning international students are required to have TB testing prior
                                 to registration for classes. This testing process takes 48-72 hours to complete. If
                                 a student has ever received the BCG vaccine or a positive TB test, a chest x-ray is
                                 required. This is another 48-72 hour process. We cannot allow registration until the
                                 TB testing is complete. Please coordinate your arrival time and registration at UVU
                                 accordingly.  If a student is required to have a chest x-ray they are referred to a community clinic
                                 located close to UVU. The cost of the x-ray is $60 and is not negotiable.

Itemized bills are available upon request to turn into insurance for reimbursement.     Women's Clinic Services        Make the Most of Your Appointment     Annual Exams  Annual gynecological exams at the Womenâ€™s Clinic include blood pressure, weight measurement, and a physical exam of the abdomen, breasts, heart, lungs, lymph nodes, thyroid gland, and a pelvic exam.  Pelvic Exams  The pelvic exam is one of the most important female health measures and it should not be confused with the Pap Test. A pelvic exam is part of any yearly routine annual exam even if a Pap test is not necessary. During your exam your practitioner will palpate (check) your external genital area, vaginal walls, cervix, uterus, ovaries, and sometimes the rectum. The pelvic exam might feel slightly uncomfortable, but should not be painful. If you have never been sexually active and do not use tampons, the exam can be modified.  Preparing For Your Exam  If you plan to have a Pap test, make your appointment for a time when you are not bleeding. Donâ€™t put anything in the vagina for 3-4 days before your appointment â€“ no douches, tampons, medications, spermicides, diaphragms, fingers, intercourse, or oral sex. Any foreign cells or outside products can interfere with the Pap test. If you are having a problem, try not to schedule your appointment after you have used any vaginal medications or soon after having sex. Vaginal medications make it impossible to visualize the discharge or vaginal tissue. Intercourse acts like a douche and makes the discharge difficult to see or collect for testing.

HPV Vaccines  Schiffert Health Center recommends the HPV vaccine . HPV, or the human papilloma virus, is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the US. Every year about 17,000 women and 9,000 men are affected by cancers caused by HPV. It is responsible for many cases of genital warts, also.  The health center has Gardasil 9 and injections are given in the Allergy and Immunization Clinic .  The vaccine can also be obtained from local pharmacies. The pharmacy can bill insurance directly.

The VCU Medical Center Campus clinic does not offer a full on-site pharmacy, but it does offer over-the-counter medications for purchase to all VCU students.Â  Students on the VCU Medical Center Campus have the option of using the Student Health Pharmacy to fill prescription medications by:   Going directly to the pharmacy at the Monroe Park Campus clinic OR  Using a free courier service that delivers prescriptions to the VCU Medical Center clinic once daily.   Payment Methods  Students are responsible for the cost of all medications dispensed. Â Prices vary and are subject to change.

Prescription Transfers To and From Outside Pharmacies  To transfer a prescription TO the Student Health Pharmacy , the student may give our pharmacy staff the outside pharmacyâ€™s information to obtain the transfer, as long as the prescription was originally written by a Student Health provider.  To transfer a prescription FROM the Student Health Pharmacy to an outside pharmacy, the student should contact the outside pharmacy and give them their name, date of birth, prescription number or drug name, and the Student Health Pharmacyâ€™s phone number (804-828-7734).Â  The outside pharmacy will then contact Student Health to have the prescription(s) transferred.  Over-the-Counter Medications  A wide variety of over-the-counter (OTC) medications are available for purchase at both campus clinics.Â  Prices are very reasonable in an effort to provide affordable services to our students.Â  Click on the link to view a complete list of our OTC products and prices .

We strive to give UWW students the best health care services possible for the segregated fees they pay. When all appointments made are used, we are able to make more appointments available to our students. When students do not keep their appointments, other students who want an appointment have to wait needlessly. When appointments are made and not kept students' segregated fee dollars are wasted.To maximize the timely services and lowest cost to the students, late cancellations or no-show appointments may result in a fee.

What about Health Insurance? expanding section    Health insurance is not required to use the Health Center and the Health Center does NOT  file insurance claims for charged services or supplies. However, students are  highly encouraged to obtain supplemental hospital-accident insurance to cover services such as hospitalization, emergency services, specialist care, major surgery, pharmacy, and ambulance transport.  Charges for these services are not covered by the Student Health Center Fee.  If health insurance coverage is available through a family plan, students are urged to have the name of the insurance carrier and policy/subscriber numbers available on campus. Students with US citizenship who are not covered under family policies are encouraged to consult the Marketplace website at www.healthcare.gov for information on health insurance.     Expand all                    a month ago       UW-La Crosse Student Health Center  Let's talk about Lyme's (not the one in your drinks)! Lyme's Disease is caused by a bacterium carried by ticks and spread through a tick bite.

With the weather warming up, it is officially tick season in Wisconsin. Ticks are most abundant in the summer months, but are around from about April to October. 

Symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a skin rash. If left untreated, the infection can spread to the whole body including joints, the heart, and the nervous system. 

In Wisconsin, there is so much to explore in the outdoors. To avoid ticks and tick bites, follow these tips:
-Walk in the middle of trails and avoid interaction with logs, trees, and brush.
-Wear a hat
-Wear a long-sleeved shirt fitted at the waist
-Wear long pants
-Consider Deet (a chemical repellant) for skin
-Where white or light colored clothes so it is easier to see ticks on the body
-Do tick checks immediately and 3 days after outdoor activity
-If you find a tick, remove it carefully and safely save it       a month ago       UW-La Crosse Student Health Center  Do you know what shouldn't make you LOL? Text neck. Text neck refers to neck pain and damage sustained from looking down at your cell phone, tablet, or other wireless devices too frequently and for too long. 

It is not only caused by looking down at a phone, but reading and writing. However, with our shifting culture, people tend to be on their phones more and starting at younger ages. 

Text neck most commonly causes neck pain and soreness, and can lead to upper back pain ranging in severity. It can also cause pain in the shoulders and painful muscle spasms. 

It is important that you hold your cell phone at eye level as much as possible, take frequent breaks, and make sure all devices are positions that allow your head to be squarely in line with your shoulders and spine.       a month ago       UW-La Crosse Student Health Center  Happy Monday! We are back with another Meet Your Provider Monday. This week, we are featuring Jenny Scott:

Role: Medical Laboratory Technologist

Years with UWL: It will be 3 years in October

Health passion: I enjoy meeting all students who walk into the laboratory for testing, and strive to provide accurate lab results. I also really enjoy reading about physical wellness and nutrition.

Favorite pastime:  I love traveling, cycling, hiking, reading, and spending time with my husband at our cottage.

Fun fact: I completed a half-Ironman in 2015! I had done a few sprint triathlons prior and wanted to set a goal that really pushed myself out of my comfort zone. I met some great people while training, and enjoyed the many, many miles I spent outside swimming, biking and running!

Deciding on the best method for your lifestyle can be confusing. We try to help you figure out which route to take by giving you information on the available options.  First ask yourself these questions:   How effective is this method at preventing pregnancy?  Is this method easy to use?  How often do I have sex?  Do I need protection from STDs?  Will I feel comfortable using this method?  How does my partner feel about using this method?  How much will it cost?  Is this method safe?   Additional Resources  Planned Parenthood  Mayo Clinic  What are the options available at the Student Health Center?  The Student Health Center offers the following birth control options:   Condoms â€“ free at the reception desk and Titan Well Booth  Birth Control Pills*  NuvaRing (the Ring)*  Depo Provera (the Shot)*  Plan B (emergency contraception)   * To get started on prescription birth control, make an appointment at via the Student Health Portal with a health care provider.

GYN Exam and PAP Test   Gynecological Exam and PAP Test  Gynecological care is concerned with the sexual and reproductive health of women and their gender-related illnesses.  Why itâ€™s Important to Have Regular Gynecological Exams:   Information . You can get accurate information and confidential answers to any questions you may have concerning sex, sexuality, your changing body, pregnancy, and menstruation.  Prevention . Allows for early detection of cancer of the breast and cervix along with learning about pregnancy prevention, sexually transmitted infections, and healthy lifestyles.  Treatment . For women who experience missed, heavy, or painful periods or other reproductive problems, the provider can look into why the problems are occurring and offer treatment. This includes both you and your provider becoming more familiar with you and your families medical history. Before you go for your first visit to the gynecologist, you should find out as much as you can about the medical history of other females in your family. Have they had painful periods, endometriosis, surgeries, anemia, cancer, or other chronic illnesses?   It is recommended that females have their first Pap smear screening at the age of 21.Â  A Pap smear is a test that looks for precancerous or cancerous cells of the cervix (the opening of the uterus). Therefore only females age 21 and older are recommended to start pelvic and breast exams. Individuals less than 21 are recommended to have a complete physical exam annually however breast and pelvic exams will only be performed as needed.    Before the Exam  When you decide to make an appointment for a gynecological exam with your provider, make sure to schedule it to take place during the middle of your menstrual cycle. Avoid sexual intercourse, vaginal douching, or putting anything into your vagina (such as tampons, lubrication, or vaginal medication) for 48 hours before the exam.  Think ahead about the questions youâ€™d like to ask your provider. Some areas where you may have questions include birth control methods, common infections, irregular periods, and painful or heavy periods.  Gather your family medical history, especially your motherâ€™s and sisterâ€™s history, as your medical provider will want to know about them as well.    On the Day of the Exam  On the day of your scheduled exam you do not need to do anything special. Shower normally with soap and water, but avoid using powders or creams, since they can affect test results.    The Results  Pap smear results take approximately 1 week and will be reported to you through a secure message on the Student Health Portal .Â  Infection testing results, including sexually transmitted infections, could be available either during the appointment or within 48 hours. Please check with your provider regarding when and how to expect the results.  You may schedule a gynecological appointment online using the Student Health Portal. You may also secure message the Student Health Center through the Student Health Portal with any questions or concerns you may have.  Additional information about pelvic exams can be found on the Mayo Clinic website .      Illnesses and Injuries   The Student Health Center will evaluate and treat all common illnesses and injuries. For emergency or trauma care, we will refer you to the appropriate resource.  Visit your Student Health Portal to send a secure message to a healthcare provider or to schedule an appointment.

There is no charge for a health services office visit. Other health services are provided at low cost to students.  If treatment is not possible on site at the SHCC, the students will be referred to their family physician or other available area care. The SHCC has a physician contracted to provide medical direction and oversight.  Students may also be referred to local walk-in clinics or emergency rooms of nearby hospitals during off hours or when the care requires more complicated medical intervention. At these times the student or their health insurance will be charged for the service they receive at these sites.    Dispensing antibiotics and selective over the counter medicine: Over the counter medications may be dispensed at no charge to students for minor illnesses or injuries. These include non-narcotic pain medicines such as ibuprofen and Tylenol, cough syrup, throat lozenges, antacids, diarrhea pills, first aid ointments and lotions for itchy rashes and stings and do not require a Doctors order. All medications are dispensed with instructions.    Dressing changes and suture removal: Occasionally wounds such as lacerations or blisters or burns must be evaluated for progress. They may require dressing changes on a regular basis, or the student is unable to change the bandage. This care may be provided at the SHCC office.  Students may have sutures (stitches) or staples that were placed at another site, such as an emergency room or doctor's office. These may be removed by the SHCC Health Nurse for a nominal fee.    Loan and fitting splints, and crutches: Crutches are available for a free of charge short-term loan. They will be fitted for use and the student will be instructed in correct crutch-walking technique. Students must sign a loan form and return the equipment in a timely manner.    Strep Throat Test: When a student is examined for a sore throat and the evidence points to the need for a Strep test, Quick Strep tests are available and are done in the Student Health & Counseling Center . If the test is positive for Strep A, the SHCC health nurse is able to dispense an antibiotic for a nominal fee. If the test is negative, the student is advised how to treat the symptoms and over-the-counter medicines are dispensed    Pregnancy test: Pregnancy tests are done by the SHCC health nurse after an initial evaluation proves it is necessary. Because of the need to have a concentrated urine specimen, the test is done only on the first urine specimen in the morning. The student is instructed to bring such a specimen into the SHCC before 10:00 AM. A specimen container may be picked up at SH&CC the day before, or the urine may be brought in any suitable clean container from home. The test is done right away and the results are available within five minutes. Depending on the results, advice and/or referral is made for further evaluation and follow-up.    TB (Mantoux) Skin Screening: There are several programs on campus which require a TB test for advancement into the course, i.e. Nursing or Teacher Education programs. Occasionally, students may request a TB tests for other reasons, i.e. personal reasons or employment. The test requires a small amount of solution to be injected under the skin of the inner forearm with a very tin needle. This site is then 'read' in 48-72 hours for any redness and/or raised area. At the time of the 'reading', a copy of the test is given or a referral is made for further testing if the results are Positive. Because of the time frame, TB tests are only done on MON, TUE, WED, or FRI. NO TB tests are done on THURSDAYS. There is a nominal charge for this test.    Counseling for general and reproductive health concerns: In every contact between the student and nurse, there is an element of counseling and/or education. It is in the best interest of both parties to be informed and participate in good health practices.               Measles, Mumps, Rubella vaccination: This combination vaccination provides protection against measles, mumps and rubella. The general guidelines for anyone 18 years of age or older, who was born after 1956, should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine unless they can show that they have had either the vaccines or the diseases. For adults born before 1956 may be given one injection of MMR unless they have proof of having the diseases.  Measles is a virus that causes rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and fever. It can lead to ear infection, pneumonia, seizures, brain damage and death.  Mumps is a virus that causes fever, headache, and swollen salivary glands. It can lead to deafness, meningitis, painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and rarely, death.  Rubella (German Measles) caused by a virus that causes rash, mild fever, and arthritis. If a woman gets this disease when she is pregnant, she could lose the pregnancy or have a baby with serious birth defects.   Meningitis Vaccination   Meningitis is an bacterial and a viral infectious disease of the fluid surrounding the brain and the spinal cord. Meningococcal disease also causes blood infections. The meningococcal meningitis is the leading cause of the disease in children 2-18 years of age in the United States. College freshmen who live in dormitories seem to have an increased risk of getting the disease because it is spread by aerosol, droplet, coughs, etc. (See General Information ""Frequently Asked Questions on Meningitis"" ). The vaccine is available at the SHCC. Call to reserve your vaccination if you have not already received it from your family doctor.    Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis Vaccination: This is a 'combined' injection that is necessary every 10 years to maintain immunity. It protects against tetanus (lock-jaw) caused after a cut or wound lets the germ into the body; diphtheria caused by a bacteria that can lead to inability to breathe, cause paralysis, or heart failure; and pertussis (whooping cough) can cause mild or severe spells of coughing and choking and can last for several weeks.  As important as getting immunizations is the need to have documentation on hand that list dates of all immunizations. If this is not available, contact parents, doctors, or clinics for proof for your medical records and history. This will save time and a lot of frustration for you!    Hepatitis B Vaccination  Hepatitis B is a disease that is the result of personal contact with blood borne pathogens or with other body fluids. (See ""Important Information Concerning Hepatitis B"" ) The immunization regimen is a series of three (3) injections given at 0, 1 month, and 6 months. This is given at low cost. There is no charge for students up to their 19th birthday or younger .    Influenza (FLU) Vaccine Vaccination  FLU (influenza) is an acute contagious respiratory disease that is characterized by fever, fatigue, body aches and pains. It is prevalent every year between October and April. FLU vaccine is available for a very low cost to students.    Allergy Injections  If allergy injections are required for students, it is possible to receive them at the SHCC. There are specific criteria, however. Students must obtain a form from SHCC and have their allergist complete it, and return it before or at the time of the first injection. Allergy serum must be obtained by the student and brought to SHCC for storage. Injections are given in accord with the allergist's written instructions.  The student must receive their initial allergy injection(s) from the allergist before arranging to have them administered at the SHCC. Student must wait at the SHCC 20 minutes after injection(s) for observation. There is a $25.00 per semester fee for this service, due on the first visit of the semester.  The SHCC does not provide allergy testing or serum    Contraceptive supplies: There are a variety of contraceptive products available to students from the SHCC. These products include Oral Contraceptives, Depo Provera injections, and condoms. All products are available at low cost to students. There is also information available on Safe(r) sex, including abstinence. Printed brochures are FREE!           ""The only dumb question is the one you don't ask.""

Medical Services  Mental Health  Violence Prevention  SURVIVOR SERVICES  Prevention  Insurance  Environmental & Occupational Health  Home / Front / Womenâ€™s Health Clinic offers many contraception options  Womenâ€™s Health Clinic offers many contraception options    Womenâ€™s Health Clinic offers many accessible contraception options     The University Health Services (UHS) Womenâ€™s Health Clinic provides consultations, prescriptions, and insertion and removal of all contraceptive options. Contraception can be used for pregnancy prevention and/or health benefits unrelated to sexual activity, such as cancer prevention, acne control, and improvement in menstrual bleeding and cramps.  Committed to improving and sustaining access to contraception on campus, the Womenâ€™s Health Clinic implemented several changes in recent years including open access appointments for students seeking many forms of contraception.  â€œIf a student wakes up and decides â€˜Today I want to come in and talk to someone about contraception,â€™ our clinic reserves appointments throughout the day so that there is availability,â€ says Dr. Mary Landry , a gynecologist at the Womenâ€™s Health Clinic.  Open access appointments serve students who are concerned about pregnancy, have health problems treated by contraception , are victims of an unwanted sexual encounter, or who are motivated to talk about or start a more effective form of contraception, says Landry.  A second strategy to increase access includes telehealth visits.Â  In 2014, the Womenâ€™s Health Clinic began offering telehealth visits for IUD consults to increase access and reach students beyond those who make appointments for contraception consultations in the clinic. This type of consult uses a combination of website links and written instructions through myUHS secure messaging.Â  Telehealth consultations resulted in twice as many IUD insertions in the fall 2017 semester after implementation compared to fall 2016.  â€œWhen students make a decision about which device they want, we can provide a single-visit IUD insertion and avoid additional consultation visits,â€ says Landry. Â Adding more staff with IUD skills has increased capacity.Â  â€œWe now have four of our six Womenâ€™s Health Clinic providers who can perform this procedure.â€  â€œMedical staff in the Womenâ€™s Health Clinic regularly evaluate student barriers to contraception access, including financial,â€ says Landry. â€œIn 2016, our nurses worked with the UW Health pharmacy to address insurance barriers to long acting reversible contraception and were able to increase access to IUDs from 148 students to 320 students the following year.â€  There are two components to the cost of an IUD: the device cost and the insertion cost. The cost of the IUD insertion is free through student segregated fees, and most insurance providers cover the cost of the device.  For uninsured students, there are options to access contraception at a reduced cost or for no cost. These programs have been in place at UHS for more than 10 years. Uninsured students who are U.S. citizens can get the family planning waiver through access.wisconsin.gov , which allows students to access free contraceptive services and supplies. UHS can help any uninsured student obtain a progesterone IUD at no cost through the ARCH foundation .  For students who decide they want to start oral contraceptives or a vaginal ring the day of their consultation, UHS offers a â€œquick startâ€ voucher program that pays for one pack of contraception, even if students are uninsured.  â€œThis allows time for family planning program funding to come in to pay for the rest of the prescription,â€ says Landry.  With continued efforts to address access barriers, beginning next month, the Womenâ€™s Health Clinic will pilot a new Telehealth appointment for all types of contraception. If a student is interested in starting a form of contraception other than Nexplanon or an IUD, they will be able to schedule a phone appointment in MyUHS and get their prescription that day without having to come to the clinic.  All students can access information about contraception options and womenâ€™s health services available at UHS through at https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/medical/womens-health-contraception/ .

A wide range of gynecological services are offered to help you build the foundations of good health habits.   Schedule an Appointment      Women's Clinic Services       Routine annual womenâ€™s exam; includes    hematocrit (a finger-prick blood test);    urinalysis;    breast exam;    physical exam (including a Pap smear and pelvic exam);    STD/STI testing (optional during an annual exam; discuss your concerns with your practitioner to determine if testing for STD/STI is necessary for you).      Birth control advice and prescriptions    Management of IUD placements and implants      Sexually transmitted disease/infection (STD/STI) testing and treatment    STD/STI testing is offered at your annual exam, or you can schedule an appointment to be tested. The Womenâ€™s Clinic is able to test a variety of STDs/STIs including HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, herpes and gonorrhea. Results are usually available within a few days, and a follow-up appointment is required to review the tests results. Test results cannot be given over the phone.      Emergency contraception prescriptions for students age 17 and younger. (No prescription is necessary for women ages 18 and up.)    Gardasil (HPV immunization)    Gardasil is a three-part vaccine series designed to protect against four of the most common strains of HPV that cause 70 percent of cervical cancers and 90 percent of genital warts. It is highly recommended for women nine to 26 years old and is available through the Allergy and Immunization Clinic. Appointments for the Gardasil vaccine usually last 10 minutes with little to no wait time after the injection. You are expected to pay for only the injection you receive at your appointment, not for the entire three-part vaccine at once. Schedule an appointment to receive the vaccine.      HIV testing    HIV testing is done by blood sample. Results are ready for review with the patient in a few days.      Pregnancy testing and referrals    Pregnancy testing can be done by either a urine or blood test. Urine tests will have results in five to 10 minutes, and the results of the blood tests are available in 12 to 24 hours.      Breast health assessment    A clinical breast exam is performed during the routine annual exam. You can also schedule an appointment if you have a problem or concern.      Evaluation and treatment for other common womenâ€™s health issues such as    menstrual concerns (cramps, irregular bleeding, PMS, other related problems);    vaginal infections;    urinary tract infections;    sexual assault support services .       Although the Womenâ€™s Clinic would like to meet all the needs of the female population, there are some services that the clinic cannot perform. The Womenâ€™s Clinic will be happy to provide you with a referral to OB-GYN physicians in the area that are available to help with these services. Services the Womenâ€™s Clinic cannot perform include    Colposcopies (a procedure performed to detect early precancerous lesions)    Prenatal care         Frequently Asked Questions        Itâ€™s my first visit to the Womenâ€™s Clinic. What should I expect?     If your first visit to the Womenâ€™s Clinic is for your annual exam, you should allow ample time for your appointment as an annual exam appointment averages about an hour, much longer than other types of visits to the Womenâ€™s Clinic. During this time, you will be filling out paperwork concerning your personal and family health history, your height and weight will be measured, and the following procedures will be performed: hematocrit (finger prick/stick), urinalysis, head-to-toe physical, breast exam, Pap smear and pelvic exam.   If your first visit is a problem visit, your appointment will most likely require much less time than an annual exam. During your appointment, your vitals will be taken and your problem and concerns will be discussed with the nurse or nurse practitioner. Any additional tests or exams will depend on the problem.       How do I choose a method of birth control?     There are many decisions to make when choosing the right birth control method for you, from what type of hormones to how often you want to remember to take it (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.). If you are not sure which method of birth control is best for you and your lifestyle, the nurse or nurse practitioner will discuss the different types of birth control with you. Usually, you will be able to make an informed decision within the visit.       How do I take the pill?     The quick-start method (starting the pill on the day of your exam) has become the easiest and most popular method to start the oral contraceptive pill. Another option is to start taking the active pills on the first day of your period. There is no wrong time to start the birth control pill, but it is important to remember, once beginning, to take the pill about the same time every day (plus or minus one hour).       I missed one of my pills. What do I do now?     When taking birth control pills, it is important to remember to take your active pills about the same time every day. However, if you do miss an active pill, there are steps you can take to get back on track.     If you miss one active pill, take it as soon as you remember. Take your next pill at your regularly scheduled time; this could mean taking two pills in one day.    If you miss two active pills in a row, take two pills on the day you remember and take two pills the next day. Then take one active pill daily.    If you miss three active pills in a row, you may start a withdrawal bleed. If you are taking a monophasic pill (a pill that contains the same amount of hormones in each pill), you can start taking your pills where you left off, skipping the placebo pills and go to a new pack of pills. If you are taking a tri-phasic pill (a pill that contains varied levels of hormones), once you have started a withdrawal bleed, start a new pack of pills, using a backup method for seven days.         Iâ€™m almost out of birth control. How do I get more?     If you are approaching the time for your annual exam, make an appointment for your annual exam, and the Womenâ€™s Clinic will refill your prescription at that time. If your prescription will run out before your next annual appointment, there is no need to run out of birth control pills. Simply call and schedule a 15-minute appointment with the Womenâ€™s Clinic or come to Redfern and ask to be seen in the nurseâ€™s clinic, where you will be provided with a prescription to last you until your next annual exam.       I have just started taking the pill and have spotting. What should I do?     During the first few months of taking the pill, your body will be adjusting to the introduction of hormones, so you might experience spotting between withdrawal bleeds, called breakthrough bleeding. If you continue to experience breakthrough bleeding after three cycles on your pill, you should make an appointment to change your birth control prescription. Emotional changes lasting more than three weeks warrant a change in birth control, and you should make an appointment to change your prescription.       Thereâ€™s been a change in my period. Should I be concerned?     If you have started taking birth control, thereâ€™s no need to be concerned. Withdrawal bleeds on birth control usually are lighter, shorter and less painful. If the period/withdrawal bleed is heavier, longer or more painful, you will need to make an appointment with the Womenâ€™s Clinic to see a nurse practitioner.       I think I might be pregnant. What should I do?     If you have concerns about pregnancy, schedule an appointment with the Womenâ€™s Clinic. We can address these concerns and provide you with reliable testing. Serum and urine testing is available through Student Health Services' laboratory. Urine test results are available in five to 10 minutes, while serum blood test results take 12 to 24 hours.       What is emergency contraceptive and how can I get it?     Plan B (also called the Morning After Pill/Emergency Contraceptive) is a backup birth control method that can prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or when other methods of contraception fail. It is most effective if taken immediately after unprotected intercourse has occurred. If taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, studies show that pregnancy can be reduced by 89 percent, and while the percentage decreases over time, Plan B can be effective up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. To take Plan B, take one tablet as soon as possible and take the second tablet within 12 hours of taking the first. Or you can take both tablets at the same time; it is just as effective and easier (since it prevents forgetting to take second tablet).   If you are 18 years or older, you do not need a prescription to obtain Plan B. Redfernâ€™s Pharmacy does offer Plan B. For privacy, a notepad is located at the pharmacy window for requesting Plan B or refills on other medications. If you are not sure that you need Plan B, please feel free to call Student Health Services'Â Womenâ€™s Clinic.       I think Iâ€™ve been exposed to an STD. Does the Womenâ€™s Clinic really perform confidential STD testing?     Yes. All visits, medical or psychological, are strictly confidential. Your medical records cannot be released without your written consent except in the event of a life-threatening medical emergency, under subpoena or for reporting certain contagious diseases.       I think Iâ€™ve been sexually assaulted. What should I do?     If you think you have been sexually assaulted, it is important that you take the following steps.   DO    Go to a safe place    Call someone you trust for support    Call 911    Seek medical attention as soon as possible     If the attack occurred in the last 72 hours, it is important that you do not do any of the things listed below before going to the emergency room. If you believe you were given a date rape drug, be sure to tell the emergency room personnel.

There are a wide range of privileges at HWS including surgical and traumatic, orthopedics, gynecology, otolaryngology, urology, and psychiatry.  We are led by an executive director appointed by and responsible to the vice president of Student Affairs. The executive director is advised on general issues by the Student Health Advisory Committee (SHAC) and on day-to-day matters by the HWS administrative team.  We prefer for patients to schedule an appointment to receive services at the medical clinic.  Some of our services are available at no additional cost to students who have paid the health fee, and other services carry a cost.

To review what is available, check out: https://www.birth-control-comparison.info/  To help determine which method works for you the best, check out: https://www.arhp.org/methodmatch/  To discuss your choices with a live person, call 650-2993Â and ask to have an appointment with a â€œfemale healthâ€ educator. Check out: http://www.wwu.edu/pws/sexual_health_education_services.shtml  How do I get Hormonal Birth Control at the Student Health Center?  Consider first:  1: Â Do I have health insurance that will help pay for birth control?  If so, find out which birth control methods your insurance will cover. If you haveÂ  â€œGroup Healthâ€ insurance, the Health Center may be able to bill your insurance.  2: Where do I wish to buy the method?Â Do I wish to purchase them from the Student Health Center?  Some women find it easier to buy a birth control method on campus at the Student Health center, and have the charge go on their student account.Â  A receipt for these charges can be obtained if she wishes to bill her insurance company herself.  â€¦Or would I rather purchase them through an outside pharmacy?  Some women who have health insurance prefer to have their prescription filled at a pharmacy in the community, or a mail-order pharmacy, so that the pharmacy can bill their insurance company for them.  3: How do I get a prescription?  SHC has not previously prescribed hormonal contraceptives for me:  -OR-  It has been over one year since my last prescription from SHC :  A: Call 650-3400 and ask to make an appointment for a â€œ birth  control startâ€. This will be a brief appointment to discuss your needs and concerns, and review your medical history. Please fill out the online â€œ Womenâ€™s Health Screening â€ (option #2)Â first. Â A short term prescription birth control prescription may then be given.  OR  B: Call 650-3400 and ask to make an â€œ annual â€ appointment, at which time a more complete exam (including a pap smear if indicated) can be done, and a longer term prescription may be given.Â  Please fill out the online â€œ Womenâ€™s Health Screening â€ (option #2) before this appointment.  Your health history will be reviewed at the appointment. Â If you have had a pap smear done somewhere else within the last 12 months, it would be helpful to have those records sent to the Health Center.  I already had my once-a-year visit with the Health Center this year, but need refills. What do I do?  There may be refills available for you already at the pharmacy where you first got your pill/ring/patch. In this case, call your pharmacy to ask for refills.  If you are due for your next Depo Provera shot, call 650-3400 to make an appointment for this.  If you bought your hormonal contraceptives originally from SHC, there may be refills waiting for you here.Â  To pick up refills from us, please send a â€œweb viewâ€ message requesting your refill, and allow 24 (business day) hours. We will message you back and in most cases we will place your pills up front at the reception desk, for you to pick up.Â  In some cases, a nurse may ask you have a brief blood pressure check first.  What do I do if Iâ€™ve Missed pills or am late using birth control?

Prior to receiving allergy injections at SHS, patients must be established with a SHS clinician, to review your medical history and medications. We require orders to be signed by your allergist and submitted to SHS by fax or mail. We DO NOT accept verbal orders for dosage adjustments. We may need to contact your allergist to clarify dosages or to request necessary information.  Before receiving allergy shots at SHS, we require your allergist to provide the requested information and to sign the UAB SHS â€œAllergy Injection Protocol and Consentâ€ form. Please check with your Allergist to ensure that our request for information was received.

                              one in four college students has a sexually transmitted disease."" For this reason
                              Student Health Services seeks to promote responsible and safe sexual behavior so that
                              MSUB students can maintain good sexual health. The most important thing to remember
                              when it comes to sexual health is that the unwanted or negative effects of sexual
                              behavior are for the most part preventable if sexual health is handled responsibly.  What is safer sex?  Safer sex is any practice used to reduce the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted
                              infection (STI) or becoming pregnant.  Contraceptives  Contraceptives are a method of safer sex that includes any activity, practice, device
                              or medication that is used to reduce the risk of becoming pregnant. Some examples
                              of contraceptives include:   Birth control pills  Intrauterine device (IUD)  Depo Provera (the shot)  Vaginal Ring  Contraceptive Patch   Barrier Methods - Wrap it up!  Barrier methods are a form of safer sex involving the use of an actual barrier to
                              keep from coming into contact with another personâ€™s genitals or sexual fluids. Barrier
                              methods protect against both STIs and pregnancy and can be used in addition to another
                              form of birth control. Barrier methods include:   Condoms  Dental Dams  Gloves or Finger Cots   35% of MSUB students reported using a condom or other barrier method for vaginal sex
                                 within the last month.Â According to the Centers for Disease Control â€œcorrect and consistent
                                 use of latex male condoms can reduce the risk of STD transmission.â€ Therefore the
                                 use of condoms during each and every sex act including oral sex is suggested to protect
                                 yourself and your partner from contracting an STI.Â Herpes, Hepatitis B, gonorrhea
                                 and syphilis can all be easily transmitted through oral sex. Only 6% of MSUB students
                                 reported using a condom or barrier for oral sex within the last month.  Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are
                              infections or diseases that are spread through sexual contact. STIs can be spread
                              through oral, vaginal, anal and sometimes even digital sex (stimulation of the genitals
                              with the hands or fingers). Many STIs have no signs or symptoms meaning many people
                              may not be aware they have one and could continue to pass it on to other people. Many
                              STIs are curable often with just one dose of medication. But if STIs go untreated
                              for long periods of time they can have long-term negative health effects.  The 4 Hâ€™s- The 4 STIs that are not curable (meaning you have them for life) are:   Herpes  HIV/AIDS  HPV  Hepatitis   Where to get FREE STI testing?

More than one method may be needed to prevent pregnancy and HIV/STIs. If no method is used, the chance of pregnancy is 85 to 90%. Percent failure rate is the number of pregnancies expected per 100 females per year.    â€¢ Abstinence â€“ no sexual intercourse between a female and a male. 0% failure rate for pregnancy and HIV/STIs.    â€¢ Birth Control Patch â€“ hormones from a prescribed patch worn on the skin weekly for 3 weeks; not worn the 4th week. 1% failure rate. Does not prevent HIV/STIs.    â€¢ Birth Control Pill â€“ prescribed hormones in pill form. 3% failure rate. Does not prevent HIV/STIs. Some medicines can make the pill less effective.    â€¢ Cervical Cap â€“ Prescribed plastic cap placed over the opening of the cervix. Used with spermicide. 16% failure rate for females who have not given birth; 32% for females who have. Does not prevent HIV/STIs.    â€¢ Condom (Female) â€“ OTC polyurethane barrier placed inside the vagina. 21% failure rate. May give some protection against HIV/STIs. Should not be used at same time with a male condom.    â€¢ Condom (Male) â€“ OTC latex or polyurethane sheath worn over an erect penis. 11% failure rate. Latex condoms help protect against gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV and are more durable than ones made of animal membranes, which do not prevent HIV/STIs.    â€¢ Depo-Provera â€“ prescribed contraceptive injected every 3 months. Less than 1% failure rate. Does not prevent HIV/STIs.    â€¢ Diaphragm â€“ reusable, thin, soft, rubber cap that covers the cervix. Used with spermicide. 17% failure rate. Does not protect against HIV. May help protect against chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis.    â€¢ Emergency Hormonal Contraception Pills or IUD Insertion â€“ prescribed pills need to be started within 5 days; IUD within 7 days after unprotected sex. About 3-20% failure rate for pills (the sooner taken, the more effective); less than 1% for IUD. Neither prevent HIV/STIs.    â€¢ FemCapÂ® â€“ Prescribed silicone rubber device that fits snugly over the cervix.14% failure rate for females who have not given birth; 29% for females who have. Does not prevent HIV/STIs.    â€¢ Implanon â€“ thin plastic implant that releases the hormone progestin for up to 3 years. Less than 1% failure rate.

Less than 1% failure rate. Does not prevent HIV/STIs.    â€¢ Intrauterine System (IUS) â€“ MirenaÂ®, device placed in uterus by health care provider. Can remain in place for 5 years. Less than 1% failure rate. Does not prevent HIV/STIs.    â€¢ Leaâ€™s ShieldÂ® â€“ Prescribed silicone rubber device that fits snugly over the cervix. Used with spermicide. 15% failure rate. Does not prevent HIV/STIs.    â€¢ Natural Family Planning (Fertility Awareness, Periodic Abstinence) â€“ sex must be limited to â€œsafe days.â€ About 20% failure rate. Does not prevent HIV/STIs.    â€¢ NuvaRingÂ® â€“ prescribed contraceptive ring that a female inserts into the vagina. The ring stays in place for 3 weeks; is removed the week of menstrual period. 1% failure rate. Does not prevent HIV/STIs.    â€¢ Spermicides (Foams, Jellies, Creams, etc.) â€“ spermicides inserted into the vagina that kill sperm before entering the uterus. 21% failure rate. Available over-the-counter. More reliable when used with barrier methods (condoms, diaphragms). Inserted between 5 and 90 minutes before intercourse. Need to reapply for repeated acts of intercourse.    â€¢ Sterilization (Female) â€“ surgical, permanent form of birth control to burn, cut, or tie off the fallopian tubes. Less than 1% failure rate.

Gives some protection for STIs.    â€¢ Withdrawal â€“ removal of the penis before ejaculation. 19% failure rate. Does not prevent HIV/STIs. Control of ejaculation is necessary and sperm may leak before this occurs.             Signs of Pregnancy    â€¢ Missed menstrual periods. { Note: Stress or illness can cause a period to be late, too. And, some females do not have regular periods. It may be hard for them to know if their period is 2 weeks late. Other females can have a light menstrual period or spotting and still be pregnant. So watch for other signs also listed here.}    â€¢ Abnormal vaginal bleeding.    â€¢ Breast tenderness, swelling, and/or tingling.    â€¢ The dark areas around the nipples are darker than before and the tiny glands around the nipples stick up.    â€¢ Feeling tired.    â€¢ Nausea or vomiting.    â€¢ Frequent urination.    â€¢ Unusual food cravings or your taste for certain foods changes; a metallic taste in the mouth.    â€¢ Mood swings.    â€¢ Slight elevation in body temperature.    â€¢ Acne due to extra-active oil glands.

Most of these options are available through the Health and Wellness Center.  In addition, we offer pregnancy related services such as testingÂ and options counseling.  Getting Started on Birth Control  If this is your first time for requesting a birth control method which requires a prescription, you will need to schedule an appointment . You may choose to have a complete annual exam or a consultation. The annual exam includes a review of your health history, a complete physical, a pelvic exam , and possibly a PAP smear.  A consultation for hormonal contraceptives involves a review of your health history and gynecological records (if any). In addition, if you haven't had a women's health exam within the past year, you will need to schedule one.  Regardless of which type of appointment you choose, a clinician will provide information about various contraceptive options along with their risks and benefits. To better understand your options prior to your visit, please review the information for various birth control choices .  Note: If this is your first visit to receive women's health care, you need to complete and bring the womenâ€™s Health History form to your appointment.  Getting Contraceptive Refills  If your oral contraceptive was prescribed by the Health and Wellness Center, you can obtain your refill through our office.  If your oral contraceptive was not prescribed by the Health and Wellness Center and you need a refill, you must have your clinician fax your most recent gynecological records and related laboratory results to us (814-898-6924). If this isn't possible, then you will need to make a brief appointment with one of our healthcare providers. These appointments are usually available within a day or two. At this appointment, you will be asked to complete a health history questionnaire which will be reviewed with you. Unless your health history indicates a contraindication to hormonal birth control, the clinician will then prescribe an oral contraceptive. Or, if your annual exam is due, schedule an appointment for an annual exam where a history, physical, and essential laboratory tests will be done and your contraceptive method continued.  If you use DepoProvera and are due for an injection, you will need to provide a copy of your last injection visit. Your clinician may fax the record to the Health and Wellness Center (814-898-6924).  Pregnancy Related Services  Pregnancy testing is readily available by appointment at the Health and Wellness Center. If the test is positive, you are encouraged to schedule a confirmation exam . This consists of a pelvic exam to determine how many weeks you are along in your pregnancy.  For patients who are pregnant and unsure of their options, we offer ""options counseling"" by appointment . To learn more about your options, see Unplanned Pregnancy: Making Choices .
