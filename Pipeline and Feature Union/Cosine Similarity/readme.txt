Cosine similarity considers the proximity of the two documents based on the angle between the combined vector representation of those documents. The vector representation of the document depends upon the presence or absence of every unique word in the entire corpus. Two documents that are the same will have the same vector representation and the angle between them will be zero resulting in cosine similarity as 1 whereas documents that do not have any term in common will have cosine similarity as 0. Other documents will have a score between 0 and 1 depending upon their degree of similarity. 

Since we are dealing with specific vocabulary in our study, our hypothesis was that cosine similarity is a fair measure to assess the presence of specific information. We, therefore, created a fake document with our vocabulary of LARC terms in order to compute its cosine similarity with every other document in the corpus.
